<h2><span><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></span></h2>


<p>My only qualification for writing this preface is the
circumstance that, as a representative of the Royal Economic
Society, I attended the meetings of the Committee appointed
to direct and conduct the investigations of which the results are
summarised in the following pages. From what I saw and heard
at those meetings I received the impression that the evidence
here recorded was collected with great diligence and sifted
with great care. It seems to constitute a solid contribution
to a department of political economy which has perhaps not
received as much attention as it deserves.</p>

<p>Among the aspects of women's work on which some new
light has been thrown, is the question why women in return for
the same or a not very different amount of work should often
receive very much less wages. It is a question which not only
in its bearing on social life is of the highest practical importance,
but also from a more abstract point of view is of
considerable theoretical interest, so far as it seems to present
the paradox of <i>entrepreneurs</i> paying at very different rates for
factors of production which are not so different in efficiency.</p>

<p>The question as stated has some resemblance to the well-known
demand for an explanation which Charles II. preferred
to the Royal Society: there occurs the preliminary question
whether the circumstance to be explained exists. The alleged
disproportion between the remuneration of men and women is
indeed sometimes only apparent, or at least appears to be
greater than it is really. Often, however, it is real and great
where it is not apparent.</p>

<p>On the one hand, in many cases in which at first sight
 women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
seem to be doing the same work as men for less pay, it is found
on careful inquiry, that they are not doing the same work.
"The same work nominally is not always the same work
actually," as the Editor reminds us (Chapter IV. par. 1).
"Men feeders, for instance, carry formes and do little things
about the machine which women do not do." In this and
other ways men afford to the employer a greater "net
advantageousness," as Mr. Sidney Webb puts it in his valuable study
on the "Alleged Differences in the Wages paid to Men and to
Women for similar Work" (<cite>Economic Journal</cite>, Vol. I. pp. 635
<i>et seq.</i>). The examples of this phenomenon adduced by Mr.
Webb, and in the evidence before the Royal Commission on
Labour, are supplemented by these records. To instance one
of the less obvious ways in which a difference in net
advantageousness makes itself felt, employers say: "It does not pay
to train women: they would leave us before we got the same
return for our trouble as we get from men." At the same time
it is to be noticed in many of these cases that though the work
of women is less efficient, it is not so inferior as their pay. For
instance, a Manchester employer "estimated that a woman
was two-thirds as valuable in a printer's and stationer's warehouse
as a man, and she was paid 15<i>s.</i> or 20<i>s.</i> to his 33<i>s.</i>,"
(p. 47, note).</p>

<p>In other cases the difference between the remuneration of
men and women for similar work is not obvious because they
work in different branches of industry. For example, only
five instances of women being employed as lithographic artists
are on record (Chapter IV. par. 1). Other branches of the
printing trade are as exclusively women's work. Such data
afford no direct and exact comparison between the remuneration
of the two classes in relation to the work done by them
respectively. As Mr. Webb concludes, the inferiority of
women's wages cannot be gathered "from a comparison of the
rates for identical work, for few such cases exist, but rather
from a comparison of the standards of remuneration in
 men's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
and women's occupations respectively." "Looked at in this
light," he continues, "it seems probable that women's work is
usually less highly paid than work of equivalent difficulty and
productivity done by men." As Mrs. Fawcett points out in an
important supplement to Mr. Webb's article (<cite>Economic Journal</cite>,
Vol. II. p. 174), women are crowded into classes of industry
which are less remunerative than those open to men.</p>

<p>Recognising the fact of different remuneration for the same
amount of work, we have next to consider the causes. It is
evident that the sort of explanation offered by Adam Smith for
difference of wages in different employments will not avail
much in the case with which we are dealing. The lower
remuneration of women is not brought about by way of compensation
for the greater "agreeableness" or other pleasurable
incident or perquisite of their tasks. Possibly we might refer
to this head, as well as to others, the circumstance that women
having in prospect the hopes of domestic life are likely to take
less interest in their trade than men do who cast in their lot for
life, if this difference in future prospects is attended with a
difference in the effort of attention given to work in the present.
But doubtless the explanation is to be found chiefly not in
compensation produced by the levelling action of competition,
but in the absence of competition between men and women&mdash;in
the existence of monopoly whether natural or artificial, to use
Mill's distinction (<cite>Political Economy</cite>, Vol. II. Chapter XIV.),
together with custom and what Mill calls "the unintended
effect of general social regulations."</p>

<p>A natural monopoly is constituted by the superior strength
of man, the occasional exercise of which, as just noticed, entitles
him to some superiority of pay for work which at first sight
may appear almost identical with that of women. The experience
recorded in the following pages does not afford any
expectation that this kind of superiority tends to vanish.
"There is an almost unanimous chorus of opinion that women's
work as compositors is so inferior to men's that it does
not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
pay in the long run" (Chapter IV.). Speaking of the
physiological differences between men and women in relation
to their work, the Editor concludes that "when all false
emphasis and exaggeration have been removed a considerable
residuum of difference must remain."</p>

<p>Custom and the somewhat capricious sense of decorum
counts for more than might have been expected in restricting
women to certain industries, and accordingly, on the principle
emphasised by Mrs. Fawcett, depressing their wages. "I know
my place, and I'm not going to take men's work from them,"
said a female operative to an employer who wanted her to
varnish books (Chapter IV.). "Why, that is men's work, and
we shouldn't think of doing it," was the answer given by forewomen
and others to the question why they did not turn their
hands to simple and easy processes which were being done by
men (Chapter V.).</p>

<p>Among artificial monopolies must be placed that which is
constituted by legislation. The Factory Laws, of which a
lucid summary is given (Chapter VI. § 1), impose certain
conditions on the work of women which, it may be supposed
and has been asserted, place them at a sensible disadvantage in
their competition with men, who are free from those restrictions.
But the evidence now collected goes to prove that the disadvantage
occasioned to women in their competition with men
by the Factory Acts is not appreciable; thus confirming the
conclusions obtained by the Committee which the British
Association appointed to consider this very question (Report,
1903). The evidence of the large majority of employers in the
printing trade is in favour of the Acts; the evidence of
employees is almost unanimous. Of a hundred and three
employers "not half-a-dozen remembered dismissing women in
consequence of the new enactment" (Chapter VI. § 2). Of a
hundred and three employers, who expressed an opinion,
twenty-six stated that in their opinion legislation had not
affected women's labour at all, sixty considered it to
 have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
been beneficial, and seventeen looked on all legislation as
grandmotherly and ridiculous (p. 82). The opinion of the
employers is much influenced by the experience that "after
overtime the next day's work suffers." The still stronger feeling
of the workers in favour of the Factory Acts is partly based
on the same fact: "Long hours," said one, "don't do any good,
for they mean that you work less next day: if you work all night,
then you are so tired that you have to take a day off; you have
gained nothing" (p. 86). Upon the whole the moderate conclusion
appears to be that "except in a few small houses the
employment of women as compositors has not been affected by
the Factory Acts" (p. 75). What little evidence there is to the
contrary is exhibited by the Editor with creditable candour
(p. 80). It is admitted that a "slight residuum of night work"
may have been transferred to male hands.</p>

<p>Trades unionism forms another species of "artificial
monopoly," the organisation of men in the printing trades
being much stronger than that of women. The difference is
partly accounted for by the fact, already noticed in other connections,
that woman having an eye to marriage is not equally
wedded to her trade. Some frankly admit that "marriage
is sure to come along, and then they will work in factories
and workshops no longer" (p. 42). Whatever the cause, it
appears from the Editor's historical retrospect that women's
unions have not flourished in the trades under consideration.
All attempts to organise women in the printing trade proper, as
distinguished from the bookbinding industry, have failed. Even
the Society of Women Employed in Bookbinding, though
organised by Mrs. Emma Paterson, seems to have had only a
moderate success. Thus the men unionists have had their way
in arranging that their standard wage should not be lowered
by the influx of cheap labour offered by women.</p>

<p>Some unions indeed admit women on equal terms with men,
with less advantage to the former than might have been
expected. A regulation of this sort adopted by the
 London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
Society of Compositors is followed by the result that "it is
practically impossible for any woman to join the society"
(p. 28). At Perth a few years ago, when women began to be
employed on general bookwork and setting up newspaper copy,
the men's union decided that the women must either be paid
the same rates as the men or be got rid of altogether (p. 46).
One general result of such <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">primâ facie</i> equalitarian regulations
is probably to promote that crowding of women into less
remunerative occupations which was above noticed as a
cardinal fact of the situation. It is for this reason apparently
that Mrs. Fawcett does not welcome the principle that
"women's wages should be the same as men's for the same
work." "To encourage women under all circumstances to
claim the same wages as men for the same work would be
to exclude from work altogether all those women who were
industrially less efficient than men" (see the article by
Mrs. Fawcett referred to in the <cite>Economic Journal</cite>, Vol. III.
p. 366, and compare her article in that Journal, Vol. II.
p. 174, already cited).</p>

<p>Of course it may be argued that, in view of the circumstance
that women workers are often subsidised by men and of other
incidents of family life, to permit the unrestricted competition
of men with women would tend to lower the remuneration and
degrade the character of labour as a whole. Without expressing
an opinion on this matter, seeking to explain rather than to
justify the cardinal fact that the industrial competition between
men and women is very imperfect, one may suggest that it is
favoured by another element of monopoly. The employer in a
large business has some of the powers proper to monopoly.
As Professor Marshall says (in a somewhat different connection)
"a man who employs a thousand others is in himself an absolutely
rigid combination to the extent of one thousand units
in the labour market." This consideration may render it easier
to understand how it is possible for certain employers to give
effect to the dispositions which are attributed to them in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
following passages: "Conservative notions about women's
sphere, and chivalrous prejudices about protecting them,
influence certain employers in determining what work they
<i>ought</i> to do" (p. 52). "A rigid sense of propriety based on a
certain amount of good reason, seems to determine many employers
to separate male from female departments" (p. 53).</p>

<p>A notice of this subject would be inadequate without reference
to the relation between the use of machinery and the
competition of women against men. In some cases the cheapness
of women's work averts the introduction of machinery.
"One investigator whilst being taken over certain large printing
works was shown women folding one of the illustrated weekly
papers. Folding machines were standing idle in the department,
and she was told that these were used by the men when
folding had to be done at times when the Factory Law prohibited
women's labour" (p. 98). A well-known bookbinder said:
"If women would take a fair price for work done it would not
be necessary to employ machinery." In the Warrington newspaper
offices the cheapness of women's labour makes it unnecessary
to introduce linotypes (pp. 46 and 98). On the other hand,
in the case of bookbinding, the employment of machinery makes
it possible for the less skilled and lower-paid women to do work
formerly done by men (p. 48). But the relations are not in
general so simple. Rather, as the Editor remarks, "what really
happens is an all-round shifting of the distribution of labour power
and skill, and a rearrangement of the subdivision of
labour" (p. 48). The cheerful assumption proper to abstract
economics, that labour displaced by the introduction of
machinery can turn to some other employment, is seldom, it is
to be feared, so perfectly realised as in the case of the bookbinders
below mentioned (p. 48, note): "There was much
gloom among the men when the rounding and backing
machine came in, but though profitable work was taken away
from the 'rounders' and 'backers' they had more 'lining up'
and other work to do in consequence, so nobody was turned off."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span></p>

<p>So far I have adverted to only one of the problems which are
elucidated by this investigation. A sense of proportion might
require that I should dwell on other topics of great interest
such as home work and the work of married women, the
technique of the industries connected with printing which the
Editor has described minutely, and the statistics relating to
women's wages, in the treatment of which a master hand, that of
Mr. A. L. Bowley, may be recognised. But I must not go on
like the chairman who with a lengthy opening address detains
an audience eager to hear the principal speaker. I will only in
conclusion express the hope that the Committee which has
obtained such useful results may be enabled to prosecute
further investigations with like diligence.</p>

<p class="right">F. Y. EDGEWORTH.</p>

<h2><span><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></span></h2>


<p>The investigation upon which this book is based was
undertaken by the Women's Industrial Council; the Royal
Statistical Society, the Royal Economic Society, and the
Hutchinson Trustees consenting to be represented on the Committee
responsible for the work. Upon this Committee, the
Women's Industrial Council was represented by Miss A. Black,
Miss C. Black, Mrs. Hammond, Mr. Stephen N. Fox, and
Mr. J. Ramsay Macdonald; the Royal Statistical Society by
Mr. J. A. Baines; the Royal Economic Society by Professor
F. Y. Edgeworth, and the Hutchinson Trustees by Mr.
A. L. Bowley. Mrs. Hogg also represented the Women's
Industrial Council up to her death in 1900.</p>

<p>The Committee takes this opportunity of thanking the
Hutchinson Trustees for their liberal financial assistance, and
of expressing its appreciation of the services so carefully and
enthusiastically performed by the investigators, especially those
of Mrs. Hammond, who is mainly responsible for the work done
in London; of Mrs. Oakeshott, who assisted Mrs. Hammond; of
Mrs. Muirhead, who supplied information about Birmingham;
of Miss Harrison, who investigated Bristol and the South-West,
and Leeds and district; and of Miss Irwin and Mr. Jones,
who were in charge of the Scottish enquiries. To the many
employers, Trade Union secretaries, and others who were so
willing to give assistance to the investigators, the Committee
also desires to express its gratitude.</p>

<p>Whoever has had experience in collecting and sifting such
evidence as is dealt with in this investigation knows how
difficult it is to arrive at proper values and just conclusions.
And women's trades seem to offer special difficulties of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
kind. There are no Trade Union conditions, no general trade
rules, no uniformity in apprenticeships, so far as the woman
worker is concerned, and the variations in conditions are most
striking, even between neighbouring employers drawing their
supply of labour from practically the same district, though
perhaps not from the same social strata. That difference in
strata is in some cases a predominating factor in women's
employment, and it everywhere confuses economic and industrial
considerations. When to this irregularity of conditions
is added a reticence as to "one's personal affairs," due partly
to women's lack of the sense that their position is of public
interest, and also partly to an unwillingness shown by many
employers to disclose the facts of cheap labour, it can readily
be seen that the Committee had to exercise the greatest care in
its work.</p>

<p>When the investigation was begun there was an idea that it
should be the commencement of an enquiry into women's
labour in every trade of any importance, but whether that will
be carried on or not will now depend on the reception of this
volume and on what further financial assistance is forthcoming.
The group of trades selected for first treatment shows neither
an overwhelming preponderance of women nor a very marked
increase in the employment of women. But it illustrates in
a specially normal way the main problems of women's labour
under ordinary modern conditions. Upon one important point
this group does not throw much light. The employment of
Women in the Printing Trades does not show to any satisfactory
extent the family influence of married and unmarried
women wage earners. What information the Committee was
able to gather is dealt with in its proper place, but careful
enquiries will have to be made in the highly-organised
factory industries before that wealth of fact can be obtained
from which conclusions can be drawn, with details properly
filled in, regarding the influence of women's earnings upon
family incomes.</p>

<p>In other respects these trades have yielded most interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
information. They illustrate the industrial mind and capacity
of women in the different aspects of training, rates of pay, competition
with men, influence of machinery, effect of legislation,
and so on. These subjects are dealt with under separate
chapters, and though it has been the chief aim of the Committee
to present well-sifted and reliable facts, it has stated
some conclusions which are most obvious, and which appear to
be necessary, if bare figures and dry industrial data are to carry
any sociological enlightenment. The volume is therefore offered
not as a mere description of industrial organisation, but as a
study in sociology which indicates a path ahead as well as
points out where we stand at the moment.</p>

<p>Miss Clementina Black is responsible for the description of

<span class="smaller"><i>THE TRADES DESCRIBED.</i></span>
</h2>

<p>The trades covered by this enquiry include a great number
of processes, some brief account of which is necessary if the
succeeding chapters are to be comprehensible. It will, perhaps,
be the easiest way to follow the stages by which paper is converted
into books and to return afterwards to such accessory
matters as envelope making, relief stamping, lithography, etc.</p>

<p><em>Paper-making.</em>&mdash;Paper-making is carried on mainly in the
counties of Kent, Lancashire, Buckingham, Yorkshire, Fife,
Lanark, Aberdeen and Midlothian, but mills are found scattered
over the country where water is favourable to the manufacture.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
In London, there is one mill only, and not more than thirteen
women are employed in it. Of these the majority are
occupied in sorting esparto grass, and throwing it by means
of pitchforks into machines where the abundant dust is shaken
out, and from which the grass is carried on moving bands to
the vats where it is boiled into pulp. A few older married
women are engaged in cutting rags, removing buttons, etc.;
but at the present day paper is but rarely made from rags,
and the rags so used are generally sorted and cut by machinery.
This is an instance in which machinery has undoubtedly
superseded the work of women; but, perhaps, few persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
will regret that an occupation so uninviting as the cutting up
of old rags should be undertaken rather by a machine than by
a human being. With the later processes in the manufacture
of paper&mdash;the boiling, mixing, bleaching, and refining&mdash;women
have nothing to do; but a few women are employed in
"counting" the sheets of paper before they leave the mill.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> <cite>The Directory of Paper-makers</cite> for 1903 gives the following number of
paper mills as being situated in the following counties:&mdash;Bucks, 16; Devon,
10; Durham, 9; Kent, 30; Lancashire, 44; Yorkshire, 27; Edinburgh, 17;
Lanark, 9; Stirling, 8; Fife, 7; Aberdeen, 5; Dublin, 6.</p></div>

<p>The work of the women, who are time-workers at from 8<i>s.</i>
to 10<i>s.</i> a week, requires no training. The working day begins
at 6 a.m., an earlier hour than that of any other factory or shop
dealt with in this enquiry. The machinery is kept in constant
action, double shifts of men being employed, and when it
becomes necessary to feed the machines with grass at night men
do the work performed in the day by women.</p>

<p><em>Letter-press Printing.</em>&mdash;The primary business of the "compositor"
is to "set-up type," <i>i.e.</i>, to arrange the separate
movable types in required order for printing successive lines of
words. These lines are then arranged in frames called <em>chases</em>,
each of which containing the types is known as a <em>forme</em>;
the <em>formes</em> are "locked up," that is, made firm by wooden
or metal wedges called <em>quoins</em>, and are then carried to the
press for a proof impression. The printed page passes on in
the shape of proof to the "corrector," and from him to the
author, and is then returned in order that corresponding
alterations may be made in the placing of the type. Finally,
when the whole corrected impression has been printed off,
comes the "distributing"&mdash;the removal of the types from
their places and re-sorting into the proper divisions in the
"case." Were books the only form of printed matter, this
description would cover the whole business of the compositor,
but there are also handbills and newspapers&mdash;to say nothing of
lithographic printing, which will be dealt with farther on. The
printing of handbills, etc., and the printing of newspapers,
require, each in its own way, a high degree of skill and experience,
to which women, the vast majority of whom leave the
trade comparatively young, seldom attain.</p>

<p>In the provinces, however, a few women are engaged upon
the printing of weekly or bi-weekly newspapers; and in London,
one establishment has been visited in which women regularly
do "jobbing" or "display work"&mdash;terms which cover the
printing of advertisements, posters, handbills, etc.&mdash;while at
least two other firms employ each one girl upon such work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
"None of the other workers," it is reported, "seem to care
to learn."</p>

<p>The difference between skilful and unskilful work in this
department is far greater than an uninitiated person might
suppose; and the attractiveness of a poster, advertisement or
invitation card depends very largely upon the way in which the
type is spaced.</p>

<p>In all printing houses employing women compositors, setting
up, correcting, and distributing are done by women; in the
Women's Printing Society women regularly "impose," that is,
divide up the long galleys of type into pages and place the
pages so that they may follow in proper order when the sheet is
folded, and in another firm a woman was found who could
impose; but as a general rule the "imposing" is the work of the
man or men employed to lock-up and carry about the heavy
formes. No instance has been found in which this latter work,
which in some cases is extremely heavy, is done by women.</p>

<p><em>Bookbinding.</em>&mdash;This trade covers at least two main divisions,
and one of these is minutely subdivided into a great variety of
processes. The first process is, in all cases, that of folding.
All printed matter occupying more than a single page has to be
so folded as to bring the pages into consecutive order, and this
process is essentially the same whether the printed sheet be
that of a book, a pamphlet, a magazine, or a newspaper. From
the trade point of view, however, there is a distinction between
the folding of matter intended to be bound up in a real book
cover (book-folding) and matter which is not to be bound
(printers' folding). As a general rule&mdash;liable, however, to many
exceptions&mdash;book-folding is performed in a binder's shop and
printers' folding in a printing house, whence the names. But
many printers now have a regular binding department, and
periodical or pamphlet work is on the other hand often folded
in the workshop of the publisher's binder. The line of demarcation
is therefore no very distinct one. Prospectus work is <i lang="la" xml:lang="fr">par
excellence</i> printers' folding, and so are such weekly papers as are
still folded by hand.</p>

<p>Book-folding is done by women, of whom in theory nearly all,
and in practice many, are regularly employed. The process is
practically identical in both cases. Printers' folding is carried
on in large firms chiefly by a regular staff; but in times of
pressure "job hands" or "grass hands" are called in; and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
smaller workplaces job hands do the whole of the work. Great
sheets of matter, fresh from the press, are distributed in thousands
to the workers to be folded either by hand or by machine. In the
latter case, the woman merely feeds the machine, taking care to
lay the sheet in exactly the right place. In the former, she
becomes practically a machine herself, so monotonous is the
occupation. The sheet is folded once, twice, three, or even
four times, as the case may be, on a fixed plan, and sometimes
has to be cut with a long knife as well as folded. The various
sheets of a book having been folded, the process of <em>gathering</em>
follows. Each folder has received a fixed number (probably a
thousand) copies of the same sheet, and when she has finished
folding the gatherer places the sheets in piles of each
"signature," <i>e.g.</i> the index letter which one observes on the
first page of each sheet in a book, in regular order on a long
table. She then walks up and down the side of this table collecting
one copy of each sheet and so forming a complete book.
The collection thus made passes from the gatherer to the <em>collator</em>,
who runs over it, noting by means of the printer's "signature"
that all the sheets are in order, and placing her mark on
the book, thereby becoming responsible for its accuracy. In
the case of illustrated books the process of <em>placing</em> comes at this
stage. The plates to be inserted are "fanned out"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, laid out
in fan shape&mdash;each receives a narrow strip of paste at the back
and is placed next, and stuck to, its proper page. This placing
is sometimes done by the collator, sometimes by a separate
hand. The whole process of collating is often omitted in the
case of pamphlets and small work, and the sheets then pass
straight from the folder to the stitcher or sewer. Of <em>sewing</em> or
<em>stitching</em> there are many varieties. The threads of hand-sewn
books generally pass through three bands of tape kept taut by
being attached at one end to the table at which the worker sits
and at the other to a horizontal bar above. Sometimes the
book will have been prepared by the sawing of grooves in the
back to receive the sewing. This sawing is done by men.
Stitching machines vary greatly. The simplest kind merely
inserts the unpleasant "staple-binder" of wire that is so
large a factor in the rapid decomposition of cheap books.
In these machines, one variety of which uses thread and
knots it, the pamphlet or other work in hand is placed at a
particular place in a kind of trough; the operator presses a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
treadle and the wire is mechanically passed through and pressed
flat. Other machines of a more complicated sort will sew with
thread upon tapes. In this case one girl is required to
superintend and a younger assistant to cut apart the books
which are delivered by the machine fixed at intervals upon a
long continuous tape. Such machines are worked by power
and set going by the pressure of a treadle. Pamphlets or
newspapers having neither "cover" nor "wrapper" are now
finished&mdash;unless, indeed, <em>inserts</em> or <em>insets</em> are to be placed between
the pages. These are those unattached advertisements which
fall out upon the reader's knee on a first opening, and thereby
certainly succeed in catching his attention, though not perhaps
his approval. Magazines or paper-covered books are sometimes
"wrappered" by women, a simple process consisting of
glueing the back of each book and clapping on the cover.
Bound books have end-papers added to them by women, who
also paste down the projecting tapes to the fly-pages. At this
stage the book passes into the hands of men to be touched no
more by women, except perhaps in a few subsidiary processes.
But since much debate has taken place over the allotment to
men and women of other parts of the work, it becomes
necessary to give a cursory glance at the further stages of a
book's progress.</p>

<p>On leaving the women's hands the book&mdash;now no longer a
collection of loose sheets but an entity&mdash;is placed in a machine
to be "nipped," that is, to have the back pressed; then the
edges are cut smooth in a "guillotine"; the back is glued upon
muslin and rounded, and a groove is made, by hand or machine,
at each side of the back, so that the cover may lie flat; this is
called "backing," the covering boards and cloth are cut out and
pasted together; the design and lettering are stamped upon
them in the "blocking-room"; the books are "pasted down,"
that is, are fixed into their covers by means of pasting down
the end leaves, and are "built up" in a large press. If the
designs and lettering of the cover are to be gilded, the gold-leaf
is laid on by hand according to the stamped-out pattern,
which is then restamped, and any gold-leaf not firmly
adhering is rubbed off with an old stocking. The stocking is
burned in a crucible, and the precious remainder of the gold
collected again. "Gold laying-on" is done by women; and
the workers engaged in this task do nothing else. Much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
dexterity is needed, the gold-leaf being apt to break or blow
away at the slightest breath. One investigator describes as
"seeming almost marvellous" the skill with which this difficult
material is laid in exactly the right place by means of a knife.
Women also "open-up," <i>i.e.</i>, look through the books ready to
be sent out to see that there are no flaws. Such is the life-history
of the ordinary book as it comes from the publisher,
but "publishers' binding" is not the only section of the binding
trade, and is indeed regarded by the workers as "decidedly
inferior" to "leather-work," which is emphatically distinguished
as "bookbinding." Leather-binding is employed mainly for
rebinding. It forms, as may be supposed, a comparatively
small part of the whole trade, and is practically confined to
three large firms in the West End, a few small places, and
separate rooms in some general binding establishments. The
chief difference of method lies in the better fixing together of
back and cover, the "bound" book being laced into the cover,
and in the presence of a "head-band," at top and bottom of
the back. Books to be re-bound are picked to pieces by
women and cleaned from glue, etc., re-folded, if necessary,
collated, and after being rolled flat (by a man) are sewn at a
hand press. Repairs to torn pages or plates and the removal
of stains are also done by women. This last process demands
great care and skill, "foxed" pages requiring to be dipped into
a preparation of acid which destroys not only the objectionable
stain but also the body of the paper, so that the leaf has to be
newly sized and strengthened, and naturally needs very tender
handling throughout this whole course of treatment. The best
head-bands, too, are made by women by hand, but the head-bands
of cheaper books&mdash;when they exist at all&mdash;are machine-made.
Head-band makers form a special and extremely small
class of workers.</p>

<p>A third branch of the trade is "vellum-binding," a name
which covers the binding of all ledgers, account books, and
bank books, whether bound in vellum or no. The workers
engaged in this branch form a separate group, are rarely found
on the premises of regular bookbinders, and work chiefly in a
separate department in printing houses. The employments of
women in vellum-binding are much the same as in publishers'
binding; they fold and sew much in the usual manner, the
only marked difference arising in the case of large day-books, etc.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
which are elaborately hand-sewn in frames, each section of the
book having a separate guard of linen.</p>

<p>It is difficult to draw lines of demarcation between the
various workers whose occupations have now been described.
In large workplaces a worker will probably be kept at one
minute process; the folder will do nothing but fold, the sewer
will only sew, the collator only collate, and the inserter only
insert. Some forewomen, however, think it better to give the
women a change of employment. Gold layers-on and openers-up
are always entirely apart from folders and sewers, but collators
begin with folding and sewing, and in small houses sometimes
combine one or both these processes with collating.</p>

<p>The divisions of work between men and women are not made
upon any discernible principle of fitness, and except in the case
of folding and sewing, which have belonged to women from
time immemorial, the various processes began in the hands of
men and have been gradually taken up by women. This
gradual encroachment has been generally resented and often
resisted by the men, and in May, 1893, an elaborate agreement
was drawn up by the Bookbinding Trade Section of the London
Chamber of Commerce representing the masters, and the
secretaries of the men's unions representing the men working
in the trade. The women workers were not represented or
consulted. The agreement is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Closely connected with vellum-binding are the processes of
machine-ruling, numbering, paging and perforating.</p>

<p><em>Machine-ruling</em> is the process by which lines are ruled for
ledgers, invoices, etc. The machine employed resembles a
hand-loom in appearance, and is in effect a framework in which
pens are fixed at the required distances. Ink is conveyed into
these from a pad of thick flannel above, and the page to be
ruled lies on a broad band below. The re-inking of the flannel
is in some cases effected by means of a reservoir and tap
supplying a regulated flow, in others the ink is laid on from
bowls of red or blue colour by means of a brush. Machines
worked by a handle still survive in a few places, but as a general
rule the machine is driven by power and the operator merely
superintends, correcting the machine if it goes wrong, setting
the pens and regulating the supply of ink. The newest machines
require the services of neither "feeders" nor "wetters," and
the simple old picturesque accessories, the cords, the wooden
frame, the bowls of colour, are disappearing. Women are
employed in some houses to feed the machines, which is purely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
mechanical work; our investigators found four establishments
in London in which women can rise to the higher position of
"minder," and one other in which they are allowed to damp
the flannel and partially "mind."</p>

<p><em>Numbering</em> is the process by which consecutive figures are
stamped upon cheques, bills, receipts, tickets, or other loose
sheets. A machine worked by hand is employed, the number
types changing automatically. The attention of the worker is
required on three points only: the paper must be placed so as
to bring the number into the right position; the machine must
not be allowed to skip numbers at a jump&mdash;as it is inclined to
do; and whenever an additional figure becomes necessary, a
certain change must be made. The handle of the machine
works up and down, and the process is different from that of
stamping, to be described later. There are no power machines
for numbering.</p>

<p>Numbering is said to try the eyes, and the working of a
machine handle is considered bad for girls who have any
weakness of the chest.</p>

<p><em>Paging</em> is the process by which numbers are printed upon the
pages of a bound volume. As in numbering, a change has to
be made at each "100"; and there is need of further care to
avoid missing pages. Where these are thin or interleaved with
tissue paper omissions are very easily made.</p>

<p><em>Perforating</em> is done by machines generally worked by power,
but sometimes by treadle, with one foot; and this treadle
work was described by a woman constantly employed at it
as excessively hard work.</p>

<p><em>Lithography.</em>&mdash;The work of women and girls in lithography
seems to be confined to the feeding of machines. In London
the introduction of female labour is comparatively recent,
dating from about six or seven years ago, but in the provinces
women have been employed for more than thirty years.
Employers are, for some reason or another, not very ready to
give information about this branch of work; but some of the
investigators engaged in this enquiry have succeeded in seeing
the process. A girl stands on a high platform putting sheets
into the proper place in the machine until she has completed the
job. A long interval may follow in which she may sew, knit or
read. The noise of the machine is incessant, and the work
hard, monotonous and mechanical, but if done under proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
conditions not necessarily unhealthy. Many working-places
in London, however, where space is so valuable, are partly
underground, dark and ill-ventilated, and in these the ceaseless
whirring noise and the smell of the ink grow unendurably trying.
Workers in such places are rough and of low social standing.
Most men working in the general stationery trades, and some
employers who do not employ women, condemn the doing of this
work by women, and since the women have superseded not men
but boys, the views of the workmen are not those of trade rivals.
Girls are said to be in various ways better workers than boys&mdash;cleaner-handed,
more careful and accurate, less disposed to
meddle with the machinery, and therefore less liable to accidents;
above all, quieter, more docile, and less apt to strike.
The men employed in lithography look favourably on the
employment of girls, because no girl attempts to rise into the
higher grades and "pick up" the trade without apprenticeship.
Girls do not, and boys as feeders do, "constitute a danger to
the Society." Moreover, a trade that offers only so uncertain
a chance of rising is generally disapproved for a boy.</p>

<p>The objection to the employment for girls is that they work
among men&mdash;an objection which may be a very grave one
indeed, or a comparatively slight one, according to the
character of the foreman and the management of the workshop.
It may be noted that respectable working-class parents
almost always consider this objection serious.</p>

<p>A few women are reported to be employed as lithographic
artists, but no one has been seen in the course of this enquiry.</p>

<p>Minor stationery trades are envelope-making, black bordering,
plain and relief stamping.</p>

<p><em>Envelope-making</em> has several subdivisions. The paper is first
cut to shape in machines worked by men, then passed to women
to be "cemented," <i>i.e.</i>, to be gummed upon the flaps, folded or
"creased," and stuck together. Finally the envelopes are
packed by women.</p>

<p>Cementing and folding are reckoned distinct trades. One
cementer explained to an investigator, however, that she
described herself as a folder, "for people are so ignorant that
if you say you are a cementer they think you have something
to do with the pavement." Cementing may be done by hand
or by machine, and the workers are not interchangeable. The
hand-worker spreads out the envelopes in the shape of a fan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
and passes her brush over all the flaps at once. The machine-cementer
puts 500 or 1,000 envelopes into a small machine, which
grips them and drips gum upon their flaps. The worker extricates
the envelopes one by one, and spreads them out to dry.
A more complex machine is being introduced which performs
the various processes for itself, requiring one girl to feed and
one to take-off.</p>

<p>The flaps being dry, the envelopes are taken in bundles to
the <em>folders</em>, who first "crease" them&mdash;that is, fold in the sides&mdash;then
"gum" them with a brush at the required points,
and fasten them. This process can also be performed by
a machine, and the operator in that case merely feeds the
machine with the cemented paper, and the envelope is
delivered made.</p>

<p>The envelopes are then handed on to the "packers," who
count them and make them up into packets, and the packets
into parcels.</p>

<p>Except the original cutting, still done by men, all these
processes have always been executed by women.</p>

<p>The trade of <em>black bordering</em> is carried on by women who
seldom or never perform any other process. Black bordering
is usually done by hand. The worker spreads out a number of
sheets, cards or envelopes, in such a manner as to expose only
a certain width of border, and over this exposed portion she
passes a brush. Of course, only two edges of each sheet, etc.,
can be laid ready at one time, and each object has to be "laid
out" a second time after drying. "It is marvellous to see the
speed and dexterity with which the women do the 'laying-out.'
They gather up a large number of sheets, lay them on the board
and fan them out with a piece of wood used for the purpose,
showing the most astounding accuracy of eye in leaving just
the right width exposed. Sometimes the 'laying out' is done
by a machine, and only the blacking by hand." This trade&mdash;a
steady one on the whole&mdash;has, unlike nearly all the other
stationery trades, been more prosperous owing to the South
African war&mdash;a grim little example of the way in which large
public events eddy away into undreamed of backwaters! Men
now never do black bordering, but are reported to have done so
once. Machinery is now being more widely introduced.</p>

<p><em>Plain, Relief and Cameo Stamping.</em>&mdash;Under these heads are
included all the various processes by which crests, monograms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
addresses, etc., are embossed upon notepaper, cards, programmes,
or private Christmas cards. The trade has increased
enormously of late years, and a new process has been introduced
which renders it possible to employ the printing press.
This, however, is only worth while when the order to be
executed is a very large one; and most stamping is done
by hand machines, a die being fixed into the machine and
impressed by tightly screwing down. The machine is worked
(like an ordinary copying press) by a horizontal bar, having a
ball at each end, and swung from right to left. The lighter
machines can be worked by one hand; the heavier require two,
and are found fatiguing. Some are so heavy that they can
only be worked by men. Practice is necessary in order to get
the stamp in exactly the right place, and, in relief or cameo
work, in order to mix the colours, which are rubbed on the die,
to precisely the right thickness.</p>

<p>Plain stamping&mdash;the easiest process&mdash;is that in which letters,
a coat of arms, or a trade mark, are raised but not coloured;
in relief stamping the raised surface is coloured; and in cameo
stamping (of which the registered letter envelope is an example)
a white device stands out from a coloured background.</p>

<p>When two or more colours are employed considerable care,
skill, and patience are needed. This work, in two or more
colours, is called <em>illuminating</em>; in one branch of it&mdash;the highest&mdash;gold
and silver are employed on a coloured surface, and here
women are not employed.</p>

<p><em>Show-card Mounting.</em>&mdash;Card mounting is a distinct trade,
and is almost entirely in female hands. Almanacs, advertisements,
and texts for hanging up, all belong to the province of
the card mounter, whose main business is to unite the picture
and cardboard that arrive separately in her workshop. The
board is first cut either by a man at a cutting machine&mdash;or
"guillotine"&mdash;or occasionally by a girl at a rotary machine
adjustable to different gauges; then "lined," by having paper
pasted over the back and edges. Inferior work is not lined.
Finally, the picture or print is pasted on the card, the backs of
three or four pictures being pasted at once, and each in succession
being applied to its own card. Some means of hanging up is
still needed, and various methods are in use. Sometimes eyelets
are inserted into a punched hole by means of a small machine
which a girl works by hand. Sometimes the edge is bound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
with a strip of tin, having loops attached to it; in this case
the tin strips are cut by men, and applied by hand machines,
again worked by girls. Sometimes, as in the case of maps,
charts, and large diagrams, a wooden rod is fixed at the top,
this fixing being done by girls.</p>

<p>The trade is not, it will readily be perceived, one that
demands great skill, practice or intelligence, and the majority
of the workers are very young. Still, a certain degree of experience
is necessary, since the application of either too much or
too little paste results in a "blister," and blistered work is
spoiled. One investigator was shown a lot of 500 cards, the
estimated value of which was 6<i>d.</i> each, no less than 385 of
which had thus been spoiled and rendered quite useless. The
workers stand at their work and report that it exhausts them.
It used, till about twenty-eight years ago, to be done by men;
but the trade was at that time a much smaller one. Night
work, when considered necessary, is still done by men.</p>

<p>A little laying-on of gold is done in connection with card
mounting. The process has been described already under
bookbinding.</p>

<p>The Christmas card industry (which may be considered as
a variety of show-card mounting) serves to exemplify one of the
anomalies of the Factory Act. These cards may be sorted,
packed, etc., to any hours of the night, because mere packing
is not regarded as manufacture; but if a "bow of ribbon" is
to be affixed to each card, the process becomes "preparation
for sale," and the regulations of the Act apply.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><em>Typefounding.</em>&mdash;Typefounding is a small, ancient and conservative
trade into which women have only crept during the
last few years. In London there are only about eight typefoundries
proper, and in these labour is elaborately subdivided,
every workman performing but one process. Recently, however,
some large printing houses have begun to cast their own
type, and in these the few men employed perform all the processes,
or, to use their own term, "do the work through," thus,
curiously enough, reverting to an earlier stage in the development
of the trade.</p>

<p>Women are employed in the large foundries, where they
perform certain subsidiary parts of the work. Each type when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
it comes from the machine wherein it has been cast has a little
superfluous bit of thin metal, known as a "break" on its end
or "foot." These bits are broken off by girls, the "foot" of
the type being pressed against a table and the "break" snapped
off. No great skill is required, but quickness only comes with
practice. The type is also "set-up"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, put in rows in a
long stick or "galley"&mdash;by girls; here, again, nothing is needed
beyond a certain manual dexterity. Sometimes another stage,
"rubbing," intervenes between the "breaking" and the
"setting-up." Rubbing is merely the smoothing off on a flat
grindstone of any roughness that may be left by the machine
round the "face" end of the type. In one case, in London,
one or two women were once employed in rubbing, but none
appear to be so engaged at present, and the newer appliances
have made rubbing unnecessary. "Dressing," the final process
through which the type passes, is said to be in some places
performed by women; but no such instances have been found
in London in the course of this investigation. The dresser
receives the lines or sticks of type, polishes the sides, measures
their length and breadth with a delicate spanner, "nicks"
the foot of each type, and finally "picks over" the type&mdash;that
is, scans the row of "faces" through a magnifying glass, and
rejects any on which the letters are not absolutely truly placed.</p>

<p>One large London firm, employing many girls, has a different
process. The types are cast in long lines and have to be
divided, no breaking or setting-up being required. As one of
the workers said, "This is not a trade; just any one can do it!"</p>

<p>Girls began to do "breaking" and "setting-up" in London
about thirteen years ago. There were then but thirteen so
employed. During the last few years their numbers have
increased, and it is estimated that those now employed number
from 100 to 150. One firm is known to employ fifty and
another forty. They have superseded boys, and were mainly
introduced because boys were difficult to get. The chances of
rising being small for boys, they were disinclined to enter the
trade. The chances for girls are <em>nil</em>, but this consideration
does not weigh much with girls belonging to the class that
supplies workers to typefounding. The female workers are all
young, and at present no married women seem to be employed,
a fact which may perhaps be due to the comparatively recent
entrance of women into the trade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>The occupation has a special feature of unhealthiness&mdash;the
danger of lead-poisoning; and the Factory Act, recognising
this, prohibits women, young persons or children, from taking
a meal upon the premises where typefounding is carried on.
As in other lead industries, much depends on the care and
cleanliness of the worker. To eat with hands lead-blackened
by some hours of "breaking-off" is to run considerable risk of
lead-poisoning. It is suggested that girls, being more fastidious
than boys upon such points, may possibly suffer less frequently
from the dangers involved in the industry of typefounding.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>WOMEN IN THE TRADES.</i></span>
</h2>


<h4>
<span>Census figures.</span>
</h4>

<p>Before 1841 the census occupation tables do not state the
numbers employed in the detailed trades, and even in that year
we find either that no separate return was made for
some of the industries with which this volume deals,
or that no women were employed at all. Presumably, therefore,
previous statistics would not have shown that women were
employed in these industries to any appreciable extent.</p>

<p>The following tables show the employment of women in
England and Wales and Scotland in the Printing and Kindred
Trades according to the census returns from 1841 to 1901.
The figures must be used with caution, as they include employers
as well as employed (an error, however, which is immaterial in
the case of women workers). Subsidiary helpers are also
classified with those actually entitled to be regarded as members
of the trade, and the tables do not discriminate sufficiently
between the various subdivisions of occupations. These last
two errors considerably affect the figures relating to women.
In the bookbinding section, for instance,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> the figures are
altogether misleading, since by far the greater number of women
included as bookbinders are really paper and book-folders, and
are no more entitled to the name bookbinder than a bricklayer's
labourer is to that of bricklayer.</p>

been published since 1899; but for the years that they
were issued, those relating to the printing trades were as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>WOMEN'S WORK AND ORGANISATION.</i></span>
</h2>

<h4>
<span>Women as Compositors. Historical.</span>
</h4>

<p>The subdivision of labour which has broken up the original
printing "profession" into a score or so of different trades,
each minutely subdivided in turn, has been the chief
cause of the employment of women in this industry
in modern times, although it appears that nuns were
engaged as compositors at the Ripoli Monastery Press in
Florence towards the end of the fifteenth century,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> within
half a century of the introduction of printing. Only very
exceptional women could obtain a footing in a profession
which embraced typefounding, ink-making, press-carpentry,
composing, folding, and bookbinding. The United States,
where, in so many respects, women have stepped in advance of
European conditions, boasts of Jenny Hirsch, who carried on a
printer's business in Boston about 1690, and during the next
two centuries women printers were common in the thirteen
States. It was a woman, Mary Catherine Goddard, who
printed the first issue of the "Declaration of Independence."
The years of the French Revolution also seem to be marked
by the number of women engaged in the printing trade, whether
owing to the general emancipating impulses of the time or to
the increased demand for compositors, is not quite clear. The
amiable and eccentric Thomas Beddoes, moved by the interest
he took in social affairs, and inspired by the emancipatory
movement of his time, had been struck with the opening which
the printing trades seemed to offer to women, and gave his
"Alexander's Expedition"<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> to a woman of his village, Madely,
to set up. "I know not," he wrote in the Advertisement to
the book, "if women be commonly engaged in printing, but
their nimble and delicate fingers seem extremely well adapted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>to the office of compositor, and it will be readily granted that
employment for females is amongst the greatest <i>desiderata</i> of
society." In England, however, the labour of women outside
their homes continued to be extremely limited, and the printing
trades were confined to men. During the eighteenth century
women seem to have been employed in folding and sewing book
and news sheets, but they did not come into the trade in any
considerable numbers until the nineteenth century was half
spent. This was very largely owing to the heavy nature of the
work and the long apprenticeship necessary to master the varied
details of the craft. The Provincial Typographical Society's
first constitution, issued in 1849, shows that at so recent a date
the typographical apprentice had to learn "printing and bookbinding"
or "printing and stationery."<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The printing press
used in 1800 was practically the same as that used by Gutenberg
in 1450.</p>

<p>The enormous advance in the printing trades owing to the
abolition of the stamp duties and the paper tax, together with
the spread of education and improvement in the facilities for
publishing, with their resulting large demand for printed matter,
speedily revolutionised these trades and led to the introduction
of the great machines. Pressmen became differentiated from
compositors, "minders" from layers-on or takers-off, jobbers
from book-hands, folders from makers-up; whilst bookbinding
finally became a separate trade altogether. Some of these
separate processes, needing but little skill and requiring no
apprenticeship, involving no heavy labour and no responsibility,
offered openings for women.</p>

<h4>
<span>Conflict between men and women.
</span></h4>

<p>One of the earliest references to women made by the Typographical
Association occurs in 1860, when the Executive of
the Union mentioned them in its half-yearly report.
Printing houses were then closed to Union members
on account of the employment of women. The
Typographical Society's <cite>Monthly Circular</cite> for August,
1865, for instance, states that a Bacup newspaper office was
closed to members of the Typographical Union, owing to the
employment of female labour. The exact form of employment
is not given. Again, in the report for June, 1866, the Executive
of the Union refers to having trouble with an employer who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
tried to employ female labour, but who had failed "to get suitable
applicants of the gentle sex." In 1886 it was agreed that
women should be admitted to both the Typographical Association
and the London Society of Compositors on the
same terms as men, but only one woman has availed herself
of this resolution.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> She joined the London Society of Compositors on August 30th, 1892,
but she has now ceased to be a member.</p>

</div>



<h4>
<span>Printing Trades and the Women's Movement.
</span></h4>

<p>At this point, the movement for the emancipation
of women contributes an interesting chapter to the
history of these trades.</p>

<p>The printing trades were regarded by a few of the leading
spirits in the agitation for "Women's Rights" as being well
adapted to women's skill and <i lang="la" xml:lang="fr">physique</i>, and in 1860 Miss Emily
Faithfull not only started the Victoria Press, in which women
alone were to be employed, but directed the attention of women
generally to the openings afforded them by this group of trades.
"The compositor trades," the <cite>Englishwoman's Journal</cite> (June,
1860) said, "should be in the hands of women only." Miss
Faithfull's experiments produced some considerable flutter
amongst men. At first, the men looked down upon them
with the contempt of traditional superiority; women compositors
were "to die off like birds in winter" (<i>cf.</i> <cite>Printers'
Journal</cite>, August 5th, 1867, where a correspondent stated that
"the day is far distant when such labour can hope to supersede
our own"); but some trepidation was speedily caused when it
was found that women's shops were undercutting men's, and
an alarmist article in the <cite>Printers' Register</cite> of February
6th, 1869, states that "the exertions of the advocates of
female labour in the printing business have resulted in the
establishment of a printing office where printing can be done
on lower terms than those usually charged." That year Miss
Faithfull was engaged in her libel action against Mr. Grant for
calling her an atheist, and the <cite>Publishers' Circular</cite> furiously
attacked her work. By-and-by, however, the controversy
died down. Miss Faithfull's several attempts<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> to establish
permanently a printing establishment bore fruit in the still
existing Women's Printing Society, started in 1874.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> 1860, 1869, 1873; in 1869 another Women's Printing Office was started
as a means of finding employment for educated ladies: <cite>Printers' Register</cite>,
January 6th, 1869.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p></div>

<p>As an industrial factor, however, the "Women's Movement"
has been altogether secondary, and women have been induced
to enter the trades under review mainly because the subdivision
of labour and the application of mechanical power had created
simple processes; because they were willing to accept low
wages; and because, unlike the men, who were members of
Unions, they made no efforts to interfere in the management of
the works.</p>



<h4>
<span>The London experience.
</span></h4>


<p>Partly owing to the nature of the work done and partly to
the power of the London Society of Compositors, no systematic
attempt seems to have been made generally to
introduce women compositors into London houses
since 1878, and it is of some significance to note that most of
the London firms which employed women compositors between
1873 and 1878&mdash;the period when the attempt was most actively
made&mdash;have since disappeared, owing to bad equipment and
the inferior character of their trade.</p>

<p>But the opposition to women lingered on after the attempts
to introduce them more generally had ceased. In 1879 the
London Society of Compositors decided that none of their
members should finish work set up by women, and the firm of
Messrs. Smyth and Yerworth was struck by the men's Union.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> It is interesting to note that in these days also the women only set up
the type and the men "made it up."</p></div>

<p>Commenting on this trouble, the <cite>Standard</cite>, in a leading
article (October 8th, 1879) cynically remarked: "What women
ask is not to be allowed to compete with men, which the more
sensible among them know to be impossible, but to be allowed the
chance of a small livelihood by doing the work of men a little
cheaper than men care to do it. This is underselling of course,
but it is difficult to see why, when all is said and done,
men should object to be undersold by their own wives and
daughters."</p>

<p>"<em>Capital and Labour</em>," as quoted by the <cite>Victoria Magazine</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
put the case for the women thus: "This work is much more
remunerative, and far less toilsome and irritating than the
occupation of the average nursery governess, and we anticipate
that, with proper arrangements, there will be a large
addition to the number of women compositors. The reasons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> assigned against their employment in this capacity seem to be
the outcome of pedantry, prejudice, and jealousy; and no
trade rules can be permitted to interpose obstacles to the
attainment of such a desirable object as furnishing occupation
to a number of females who are qualified by deftness of hand and
mental capacity to earn in it an honourable livelihood. What
would one of the men, who chose to leave Messrs. Smyth and
Yerworth at the behest of the Union, say, if having a daughter of
his own to assist him in his occupations, she were to be compelled
to sit idle while he was made to employ a male assistant
at high wages? Yet these men, though intelligent, capable,
and industrious, deliberately throw themselves out of work, and
become for the time paupers of their Union, because it will not
permit them to assist in perfecting any processes which have
been begun by women. This is the way in which men run
their heads against a brick wall."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11" id="Footnote_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> November, 1879.</p></div>


<p>In December, 1882, the <cite>Printers' Register</cite> published the
following notice: "In a West End office, objection having been
made to the introduction of female labour, and an undue number
of turnovers, a strike appeared imminent, but the Committee of
the Society succeeded in settling the dispute to the satisfaction
of both sides."</p>

<p>The question does not appear to have troubled the London
Society again, but in 1886, a Conference of the Typographical
Societies of the United Kingdom and Continent, held in London
(October 21st-23rd), resolved:</p>

<p>"That while strongly of opinion that women are not physically
capable of performing the duties of a compositor, this Conference
recommends their admission to membership of the
various Typographical Unions, upon the same conditions as
journeymen, provided always the females are paid strictly in
accordance with scale."</p>

<p>This resolution was subsequently adopted by the London
Society of Compositors as noted above, and is at present in
force, with the result that it is practically impossible for any
woman to join the Society.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12" id="Footnote_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> A curious point in connection with the work being sent out of London
is that except in the case of Edinburgh the greater cheapness of the work
outside London is not due so much to cheaper labour as to lower rent, etc.
Several firms out in the country in England where there is no question of a
Union preventing them, have tried to introduce women, but with very little
success. This is put down as lack of intelligence in the women. No doubt
a girl who has had only a village elementary education is not the best
material out of which to make a good compositor, and the wages offered are
not high enough to tempt town bred girls to undergo the tedium of country
life.</p>

<h4>
<span>Provincial experience.
</span></h4>

<p>The Scottish compositors are organised in the Scottish Typographical
Association, which has no women members. Women,
particularly in Edinburgh and Perth, and to a
smaller extent in Aberdeen, have been employed to
defeat the ends of the Society.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The few attempts made to organise women in the printing trades
have failed. Women have been introduced into these trades
at times of trouble with the men's Unions, and are consequently
not likely to form organisations of their own. Their work has
been so precarious and so largely confined to the mechanical
and lower grades of labour,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> that they have had no incentive to
aspire to high standards of wages or other industrial conditions.
The women employed in the actual printing processes do not
seem to have regarded their work as their permanent means
of livelihood to the same extent as folders, for instance, have
done, and have been less interested, consequently, in improving
their trade conditions; and, finally, the men's Societies,
for various reasons, some well-founded and some groundless,
have regarded women printers as a form of cheap labour&mdash;"undercutters"&mdash;and
have looked upon them as dangerous
intruders.</p>

<p>When, however, we turn to the organisation of women in the
trades dealing with printed matter, especially folding and bookbinding,
we find much greater collective activity and closer
co-operation both amongst themselves and with the men.
Their Trade Union record is still but scanty, nevertheless,
the frequent and persistent efforts of women to act jointly,
without establishing a permanent organisation, form one of
the characteristic features of the trade. This apparently is
almost entirely due to the fact that women's labour in bookbinding,
<i>e.g.</i>, in folding, was accepted by the men, and that
in all workshop matters women were the fellow-workers
and not the rivals of the men. This distinction between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
printing and bookbinding is most marked and requires to be
emphasised.</p>


<h4>
<span>Organisation amongst bookbinders.
</span></h4>


<p>The bookbinders' organisation sprang up in 1779-80, as most
organisations then did, from friendly meetings in certain houses
of call. It was at first known as "The Friends."
In 1786, the working day was from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.,
with certain breaks for meals, giving, perhaps, an
actual working time of twelve and a half hours per day. But in
March of that year, a Conference of the sections decided to ask for
a reduction of an hour per day, and their petition was followed
by the discharge of workmen.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The employers then went
further, and in May, 1786, indicted twenty-four of the ringleaders
for conspiracy. In a manifesto to the public, the men complained
that their wages were only from 15<i>s.</i> to 18<i>s.</i> per week, rising in
a few cases to a guinea, and proceeded to charge the employers
with having "with vindictive rage forced into the sweet retreats
of domestic felicity" wives who were employed in the trade.
This action on the part of the employers was not prompted,
however, by an objection to women, for, according to the
testimony of Mr. W. M. Hall,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> one of the men indicted, an
attempt was made to supply the book market as a temporary
makeshift during the dispute with the imperfect work of women.
He says, "I cannot remember the exact time of striking the
women. This I remember, it was on account of them and the
apprentices doing books in boards, by the booksellers consenting
to take them so for a time, I was appointed to strike Black
Jock's<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> women. I went at one o'clock to see Maria, his
forewoman, who used to dine in the shop, she being single.
I told her she must inform the other women of the injury
they were doing us by continuing at work. If they were
willing to serve our interest and leave their work, they should
receive their wages for doing nothing. If we gained our cause,
they should be sure of employ, and the advantage of the hour
also. Coming downstairs, I met Mr. McKinley.</p>

<p>"'Well, Mr. Hall, are you coming to work again directly?'</p>

<p>"'Sir, if you will grant the hour&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Come in here,' he says, going into his dining-room, and
setting down a large square bottle of Hollands to give me a
glass, taking one himself and pouring out another. Pat, pat,
pat! came our ladies downstairs. 'What is all this about?'
I was glad to make my escape. The six or seven women were
all subp&oelig;naed against me on the trial."</p>

<p>The narrative of this famous struggle&mdash;one of the most
important in the history of Trade Unionism, involving persecution,
imprisonment, and death&mdash;contains no further records of
the part played by women in it, but Mr. Hall's reminiscence
indicates how they behaved. The men were successful, and in
1794, the working day was again reduced, so that it lasted
from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Presumably the women shared in these
advantages, and also in that of an afternoon tea half-hour,
which was theirs exclusively until 1806, when the men, during
a period of active trade and overtime, demanded the same
privilege. James Watson, in his
"Recollections,"<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> hints
that
the kind indulgence of the women to the men, permitted in
some shops, made the afternoon tea half-hour a general
demand. "Their kind friends, the ladies, while preparing for
their own comfort, neglected not those of their less fortunate
companions, but contrived by making their tea to accommodate
them as much as possible, and the men, if not immediately
under the eye of their employer, would seat themselves on the
end of their presses for ten minutes or so and thus partake of
it." A strike to secure the half-hour was unsuccessful, but the
men gradually won their point. Mr. Watson tells how, after
the strike, it happened that he was being engaged by one of the
opposing masters. The master, "being pressed upon the point,
damned the half-hour, but said I might come in and do as I
liked. I accordingly accepted the situation, and at tea-time,
when I prepared to sit down, I expected to be supported by
the men of the shop who were well aware of my intention,
but not one of them would move. I was thus placed in an
awkward position, and could only turn to my good friends,
the ladies, to countenance my proceedings, who kindly
invited me to their tea table." In about a month, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Watson informs us, every man in the place was following his
example.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<h4>
<span>The Bible Society controversy.
</span></h4>

<p>The struggle which the bookbinders fought with most
pertinacity was, however, that which they waged against the
Religious Societies&mdash;particularly the British and
Foreign Bible Society&mdash;when attempting to cheapen
the production of religious literature by means which,
the bookbinders contended, involved unreasonably low rates of
pay. In this struggle women played a prominent part.</p>

<p>It broke out as early as 1825 when the Society for Promoting
Christian Knowledge reduced its prices and the master bookbinders
working for it reduced wages. The strike which
followed collapsed for want of funds. In 1833 the contest was
resumed with the British and Foreign Bible Society. That
year the five houses then employed by the Society reduced
wages, and it appears that when the dispute was about to be
settled by both sides accepting a compromise, a representative
of the Bible Society instructed the masters to hold out. The
men appealed to the Society, but were told that it could not
intervene. No definite settlement was ever arrived at.</p>

<p>The first petition which the men addressed to the Society in
1833 made special reference to the condition of the women
workers. "Your memorialists beg leave to state," they wrote,
"that there are a number of females (about 200) employed in
binding the books of your Society, the whole of whose wages
have been reduced in consequence of the late alteration in the
prices of these books. Their wages were before very low.
Your memorialists respectfully submit that the making it more
difficult, and in some cases impossible, for females to earn an
honest subsistence, by their labour, is in the same proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
to give potency to the seducers of female virtue." Reply and
counter-reply were made, and the Society was heartily attacked
by the Union with texts from Scripture and reflections on applied
Christianity. In the defence which the Society issued in 1834,
it is stated that its binders informed it that "competent and
industrious men in our employ earn on an average 6<i>d.</i> an hour
or 30<i>s.</i> weekly when in constant work; and women in the same
description from 8<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i> and upwards."</p>

<p>Mr. Dunning, the Union Secretary, replied that he could
prove that the scale given was an "entire falsehood," and
published a second "Address to the Religious Public," in
which the wages paid by the principal firm were given, the
average for thirteen men working out at a small fraction over
a guinea per week, and of twenty-four women at 5<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i> per
week. In 1843 the dispute was allowed to end, when the five
firms promised to pay the women on timework at rates between
7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and 15<i>s.</i> per week, and to work them only ten hours
per day.</p>

<p>In 1845 the Society decided to give all its binding to one
firm, the proprietress of which was Miss Watkins, and four
years later the most famous dispute of the series broke out.
The "controversy," as it is called in the bookbinders'
records, opened by an appeal addressed to the Society on
August 17th, 1849, by the journeymen bookbinders of London
and Westminster, in which it was alleged that Miss Watkins had
returned to piecework, and that the wages she was paying to
women averaged only 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 6<i>s.</i> per week for a longer day
than ten hours. Learners were taken on and were discharged
so soon as they were entitled to increases in wages, and a rule
was said to be in operation by which, so soon as a woman
worker was qualified to be paid more than 7<i>s.</i> a week, she was
discharged. "Exorbitant" fines were also imposed. "Females,"
remarks the appeal, "often have not the power to plead their
own cause in such matters, and being helpless in many respects
where their wages are concerned, they are trodden down until
a state of things such as described in the 'Song of the Shirt'
appals the mind with the enormity of their injuries, their
suffering, and their moral condition." The appeal contained
the following table, showing the difference in wages paid to
women working for the Bible Society and those working for
the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.</p>

<p>One of the grievances specially mentioned in this appeal was
that women were not allowed hot water, except between 4 and
4.30 p.m., and were then charged 1<i>d.</i> per week for it.</p>

<p>Immediately (August 22nd, 1849) after the issue of the
"Appeal" the women employed by Miss Watkins were asked
to sign a statement that they were perfectly satisfied with their
pay and conditions. Several signed, not knowing the purport
of the paper; others refused. On the advice of the men's
Union a counter-statement was drawn up and signed, and sent
in to the Bible Society, and on finding that the forewoman who
had taken their part, together with the active promoters of the
counter-petition, were to be discharged, the women left work,
and demanded:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That prices should be raised to the standard paid by the
Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.</p>

<p>2. That fines should be abolished.</p>

<p>3. That they should have access to cold water as well as hot
for tea.</p>

<p>4. That after the learners then employed had completed
their apprenticeship, not more than twenty learners should be
employed at one time.</p>

<p>About a hundred women had come out, and the men's Union
organised a relief fund.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_20" id="Footnote_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> It may not be amiss to copy a few sentences from Mr. Dunning's obituary
notice in the <cite>Bookbinder's Trade Circular</cite>, January 21st, 1862, of the women's
leader, Mary E. Zugg, an early and humble worker in women's organisations.
"Nothing could exceed the temper, moderation and firmness she displayed.
Possessing great energy, strong sense and great acuteness of perception,
detecting at a glance pretence from reality, she was not what was termed a
strong-minded woman, commanding great respect and but little affection, for
her goodness of heart and great regard for the feelings and welfare of others
endeared her to all." She died at the age of thirty-three of consumption on
November 13th, 1861, and is buried in Bow Cemetery.</p></div>

<p>Miss Watkins replied, denying every charge made by Mr.
Dunning, and giving 10s. as the earnings for a week of sixty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> hours. The Union replied by asking that a deputation should
be allowed to inspect the wages books of the firm. It claimed
to be in possession of the rates of wages paid to ninety-seven
folders and sewers for three weeks in August, and gave the
average as 6<i>s.</i> 2½<i>d.</i> for a sixty-hours' week, and in other respects
it supported its original charges.</p>

<p>The <cite>Times</cite> of January 25th, 1850, contains in its advertisement
columns the report of a Committee of the Southwark
Auxiliary of the Bible Society, which examined Miss Watkins'
books, and it supported her statements. The women earned
from 9<i>s.</i> to 14<i>s.</i> per week. But Mr. Dunning was not silenced,
and on March 25th he issued a long pamphlet, the last of the
"controversy" for the time. In it, it is stated that the committee
of investigation had been deceived so as to mistake
wages paid for ten days as though they were paid for a week,
and a table of wages for three weeks in September and October,
for the week ending July 28th, 1849, and for the four weeks
preceding the strike, was printed.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The wage average of the
periods was from 5<i>s.</i> 9½<i>d.</i> to 6<i>s.</i> 4½<i>d.</i> per week of sixty hours.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_21" id="Footnote_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> See p. 184.</p></div>

<p>The agitation failed. The women either found work elsewhere,
or went back under the conditions against which they
had struck. Mr. Dunning could only say that the dispute had
arrested a downward tendency in prices and wages.</p>

<p>The dispute cost the men's Union £146. This was spent
mostly in printing and postage, but it included grants amounting
to £22 given to the separate Women's Committee, which had
collected an additional fund of £650 to aid the strikers.</p>

<p>The finishers had strongly opposed the support which the
Union had given to the women, and their section, to the number
of 150, was finally expelled from the Union.</p>

<p>But whilst this unusual harmony existed between the men's
Union and the women workers, no serious attempt had been
made to organise the women permanently, either as members
of the men's Society, or in one of their own. In 1833, in an
address to the London journeymen bookbinders, a Mr. Benjamin
Teasdale, of Manchester, advised the formation of a women's
Society, but nothing appears to have been done. In 1855 they
were allowed to borrow books from the men's library on the
payment of 6<i>d.</i> a quarter. It is impossible to ascertain how
 far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
the agreement between men and masters for a nine hours' day
in 1872 really affected women, as a considerable proportion of
them had been working only for nine hours before the agreement
was made.</p>


<h4>
<span>The Society of Women employed in Bookbinding.
</span></h4>

<p>Not till 1874 was there a determined and successful attempt
made to organise women bookbinders into a Union. On
September 12th of that year "the first Society
formed for women," the Society of Women employed
in Bookbinding, was formed by Mrs. Emma Paterson,
the pioneer of women's Trade Unions in England,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
and in the following year Mrs. Paterson was sent as its delegate
to the Trade Union Congress meeting in Glasgow. This was
the first time that a woman had appeared at these parliaments
of Trade Unionism, which had been held annually since 1868.
From the commencement the relations between the men's and
the women's Societies were most cordial, and at the first annual
meeting of the latter Mrs. Paterson read a letter she had
received "some years ago" from Mr. Dunning, in which he
advised "the formation of Trades' Societies for women." The
cordial greetings extended to the new Society by its brother
organisation did not meet it everywhere. A congratulatory
resolution was moved at the London Trades' Council, and
though it received the support of the veteran George Odger,
it was met with considerable opposition. Women's labour was
cheap labour, and many of the delegates to the Trades' Council
could not get beyond that fact.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_22" id="Footnote_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> Mrs. Paterson was born in London on April 5th, 1848, and was the
daughter of H. Smith, headmaster of St. George's, Hanover Square, parish
school. In 1867 she became assistant secretary to the Club and Institute
Union, and in 1872 secretary to the Women's Suffrage Association. Next
year she married Thomas Paterson, a cabinet-maker and wood carver.
With him she visited America where she saw the Female Umbrella Makers'
Union at work. On her return to London in 1874 she formed the Women's
Protective and Provident League, the membership of which was mainly
middle class, though its object was to promote Trade Unionism amongst
women. She died December 1st, 1886, and was buried in the Paddington
Cemetery. See art. <cite>Dictionary of National Biography</cite>.</p></div>

<p>It is unnecessary to detail the somewhat uneventful career of
the Union. Mrs. Paterson, at the end of eighteen months, was
succeeded by Miss Eleanor Whyte, who still occupies the
position of secretary.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The membership began at 66 and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> reached 275&mdash;of whom only 200 were financial members&mdash;at
the end of the first year. From that time till now the
membership has been exceedingly variable, and no full and
reliable records seem to exist. But from the disconnected
information which is at our disposal, it would appear that the
two most successful years of the Society were 1876 (when 63
new members were enrolled), and 1890 (when 67 were enrolled).
In 1870 the membership was given at 210; in 1884 at 200; in
1891 at 240; in 1901 at 270; the period of depression from
1883 to 1889 seems to have tried the Society very severely.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_23" id="Footnote_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> December, 1903.</p></div>

<p>The objects of this Society are stated to be: "To maintain
and protect the rights and privileges of the trade and to grant
relief to such members as may be out of work, or afflicted with
illness." The subscription is 2<i>d.</i> per week, and an entrance fee
of 1<i>s.</i> is imposed.</p>

<p>It can hardly be expected that a Society whose membership
has probably never exceeded 270, could have much fighting
force. But agitation has never been the policy of the Society.
It has refused to join with the men in making demands upon
the employers; its representatives at Trade Union Congresses
and elsewhere have steadily resisted legal restrictions upon
labour; it has not shown itself anxious to seize what the men
regarded as opportunities to make itself felt.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_24" id="Footnote_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> In 1891 the women's Society refused to support the men's in agitating
for an eight-hours' day. In 1875 Mrs. Paterson said at the Trade Union
Congress that "the more they pressed for additional legislation the greater
obstacles they threw in the way of working women. She should rather
say let them suffer a little longer the evils of overwork and long hours." The
Union's representatives, however, have always pressed for women factory
inspectors, and on this matter Mrs. Paterson was for a good many years a
voice crying in the wilderness.</p></div>

<p>Perhaps the Union has been too willing to make requests to
good employers for better conditions, and too timorous in
helping to level up the general conditions of the trade.
Employers have not been hostile. Mr. B. Collins, the
publisher, for instance, presided over the annual meeting for
1891, and Mr. Longmans and other publishers have done the
same in other years. "I know an employer," says a writer in
the <cite>British Bookmaker</cite> of September, 1891, "who will give £100
to see a good women's Union established. Why? Because if it
could be done, its effect upon other employers would remove the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> gross inequalities of prices that at present exist to his detriment."
But this Union has never reached that point of strength when
it could bring pressure to bear on the trade for the mutual
advantage of the good employer and the woman worker.</p>

<p>As a consequence, the good relations between the men and
the women in the trade have not always been maintained, and
there was considerable ill-feeling between the two sections
during the eight hours' agitation from 1891 to 1894.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_25" id="Footnote_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> It should be noted, however, that the sentiment amongst the women as
a whole was friendly during the eight hours' agitation, although the Society
was taking no part in it officially. A writer in the <cite>British Bookmaker</cite>
for December, 1891, tells how all the women in the lacing department of
Messrs. Waterlow's (Hill Street) struck on a certain job, and how "at
another place as I stood with the pickets outside, about five o'clock one cold
afternoon, I saw something descending from an upper storey and found it was
a quart of hot tea for the benumbed men on duty below, lowered out by a
string from the women's shop."</p></div>

<p>At the present moment this Society is regarded by both men
and women mainly as a benefit club. In this respect it has
been most successful and has paid with excellent regularity.</p>


<h4>
<span>The Book-folders' Union.
</span></h4>

<p>An attempt was made in 1892 to start another Union for
women engaged in folding in printing houses. The sponsor
of the new Society was the Printers' and Stationers'
Warehousemen's and Cutters' Union. It is a significant
fact, and one which throws a great deal of
light upon the very little which one section of workers knows
even of those working at their elbow, that the organisers of the
new Union were quite unaware of the existence of the Women
Bookbinders' Society. The new Society, which called itself the
Book-folders' Union, was started during the flood of Trade
Union sentiment which followed the London Dock Strike in
1889, and its membership grew rapidly. Within five months
of its formation it is said to have numbered 500,<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and later on
the figure of 700 was quoted. A popular employer, Mrs. Bond,
had been elected secretary, and an assistant was appointed at
a wage of 18<i>s.</i> per week. This new Union was determined to
be as active as the older one had been inactive. It demanded
a minimum wage of 15<i>s.</i>, time-and-a-quarter pay for overtime, and
"no apprentices." It also demanded exemption from the nightwork
prohibition clauses of the Factory and Workshop Acts.
But the Union was doomed to an early and ignominious
 end.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
During the absence of the secretary the finances became hopelessly
involved, and a deficit in cash decided the members to
close the whole matter.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_26" id="Footnote_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> <cite>Women's Trade Union Journal</cite>, January 15th, 1893.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_27" id="Footnote_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> The fact that all definite recollection of this Union is passing away, and
that for the above information we have had to rely upon the memory of two
ladies who were indirectly interested in it, throws some light upon the
carelessness in industrial matters of the woman worker. No minutes nor
other documents can be found. "The person who had them, married," and
that was taken to have settled the matter.</p></div>

<p>The Society would not even formally amalgamate with the
older Society, partly owing to differences in method, and partly
to its disgust with its failure and disgrace.</p>


<h4>
<span>National Book-folders and Kindred Trades Union.
</span></h4>

<p>One more attempt to found a fighting women's Union was
made in 1894 by the Printing and Kindred Trades Federation.
All women employed in the Printing and Kindred
Trades were to be eligible for membership. The
attempt arose out of two disputes. In one, the
women employed by a certain firm had successfully
struck for an increase of wages and against certain conditions of
labour; in the second, women had come out to show their
sympathy with some locked-out men.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> In recognition of the
women's "courage and loyalty" the men promoted the Union.
In a month or two its membership stood at 100, and by March
1896, 350 members had joined. The membership at the end
of 1902 was 150, mostly book-folders, and the following points
are prominent in the Union's demands:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. To obtain and maintain the recognised minimum scale of
pay for every member;</p>

<p>2. To reduce hours of labour;</p>

<p>3. To regulate the relations between employers and employed.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_28" id="Footnote_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> It is interesting to note that whilst the cheapness of women's work as
compositors in Edinburgh seems to have attracted a certain class of work
from London, the men's success in keeping up wages in the London bookbinding
trade does not seem to have driven bookbinding into the provinces.
There are one or two bookbinding firms in the provinces and in Scotland
which employ girls, but mainly upon diary and account book work, the book
trade being practically untouched. <i>Cf.</i> f.n., 28-29.</p></div>

<p>It had no sick benefits, but paid £5 at death, and offered
strike pay on condition that the strike was sanctioned by the
committee. The reserve fund in 1902 was under £100.</p>

<p>In 1903 the Society approached the Printers' and Stationers'
Warehousemen praying to be recognised as a branch of that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> Union. A ballot of the men was taken, when 700 voted that
the request be granted and 334 that it be not. The Women's
Society has therefore ceased to exist as a separate organisation.</p>



<h4>
<span>The Manchester Society.
</span></h4>

<p>A Manchester Society,<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> "The Manchester and Salford
Society of Women Employed in the Bookbinding and Printing
Trades" has gained some definite success in
increasing wages during its six years of existence.
In its third Annual Report, 1899, it is stated that in
May, 1898, the Society began an attempt to increase wages to
a 10<i>s.</i> minimum after a three or four years' apprenticeship, that as
a consequence the wages of forty girls were raised in September
from 9<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i>, and that subsequently thirty others received the
shilling advance. In its next Report, 1899-1900, it states,
without giving the number of girls affected, that "they now
all receive 11<i>s.</i> and 12<i>s.</i> per week, where, prior to joining the
Union, they earned 9<i>s.</i> and 10<i>s.</i> per week." Next year the
membership was 165, and the last issued Report, 1902, whilst
stating that "a slight increase of membership" had taken place
during the year, gives no figures. "Losses through marriage
and other circumstances," the 1901 Report says, "have been
great," and the Society is kept going mainly by the devotion
of one or two persons.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_29" id="Footnote_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> The existing Society is the second attempt to organise the women in

<p>Attempts have been made to organise women elsewhere as, for
instance, in Edinburgh, where a Union of women compositors
existed for a year; also in Birmingham, where ten years ago a
Union was formed specially to include the machine-rulers who
had been introduced about ten years previously. But the
movements have failed.</p>

<p>Such is the record of the organisation of women in the trades
with which we are dealing. It is almost exclusively confined
to London and Manchester, and in London, out of 19,000
women connected with bookbinding, most of whom are book- and
paper-folders, certainly not more than 500 are organised.
In 1901, in the seven Men's Unions covering these trades there
were 41,907 members, whilst the total membership of the
Women's Unions was well under 1,000.</p>


<h4>
<span>Maintaining standards without organisation.
</span></h4>

<p>Our enquiries have discovered, however, the existence of a
kind of loose organisation of majority-rule and custom in some
firms. Standards of prices and conditions are thus
kept up. It must not be forgotten that where men
and women work together all concessions won by the
men's Unions are shared by women, as for instance,
when the Typographical Association of Scotland secured a
fifty hours' week for Aberdeen compositors. This is an interesting
feature of feminine methods. In one house we came across
two collating-rooms, one of which was staffed by older hands,
who stood upon their dignity and would not accept inferior
work or tolerate reductions in wages. The other room was
conducted after the methods of the ordinary employer of cheap
women's labour; the workpeople were careless and casual
and the room had no traditions and no industrial "public
opinion." This force of opinion, which assumes almost the
nature of caste, is most strongly developed amongst job hands.
These women manage to keep up a comparatively high standard
of pay, and we have discovered the most unusual circumstance
that in one or two instances the wages of job women have been
cut down to the Union rates. We have been told on most
trustworthy authority that the unwritten laws of these job
hands are sometimes enforced upon recalcitrant work-women
by "a hiding."</p>


<h4>
<span>Organisation in the miscellaneous trades.
</span></h4>

<p>As regards organisation in the more miscellaneous trades
included in our investigation, little has to be said. A few
 card<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
mounters once joined the Women's Printing and Kindred
Trades Union after a strike, but soon fell away, and
a Union started in 1890, of which little information
can now be obtained, included some envelope
makers: but by 1893 it, too, seems to have died.</p>

<p>No attempt has been made to organise women engaged in
the preparation of materials for printing either in London or
the provinces.</p>


<h4>
<span>The attitude of employers.
</span></h4>

<p>The attitude of employers and employed to Trade Unions at
the present moment is most varied. Naturally, a good many
employers are in no mood to encourage Unions,
because they do not know what might happen if the
women's organisations became as strong as the
men's. But, on the other hand, a considerable number of
employers working under fair conditions and doing a trade of
good quality, would welcome combination. It would help them
against their cutting competitors, and they do not object to
meet the reasonable demands of their women.
In thirty-four cases employers were not aware of the existence
of a Union at all. Fourteen forewomen knew about a Union,
eleven denied its existence.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> In no instance in London was a
non-Union woman bookbinder discovered who knew of the
existence of both the Unions, though the majority of the
women knew of the existence of one or the other.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_31" id="Footnote_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> It is important to note in connection with this point that the power of
a forewoman over women is generally more unquestioned than that of a
foreman over men.</p></div>


<h4>
<span>The women's attitude.
</span></h4>

<p>We were anxious to find out why they did not join. Some
spoke with scorn of the older Union because it was only a benefit
Society; others said, "No use in joining; you get
nothing out of it;" others thought it dangerous;
others suspected all Unions; others frankly admitted that
marriage was sure to come along, and then they would work in
factories and workshops no longer. An eloquent commentary
upon this sentiment is to be found in the figures extracted
from the Factory Inspector's Annual Reports and printed in
Chapter II. When one works out from these tables the proportion
between the males of over 18 years of age and the total
number of males employed in the various trades and compares
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> it with that of the females, it will be found that a comparatively
excessive percentage of the latter are under 18 years of age.
The same point is brought out with more emphasis and detail
in Appendix VII. The women do not, in fact, feel it necessary
to organise themselves, and a manager of a Co-operative Printing
Works, where membership of a Union is compulsory upon
women, informed us that they grumble when they are made to
join and surrender their membership as soon as they can. The
notes of some of the conversations reported are valuable indications
of the mind of the woman wage-earner in this respect.</p>

<p>We can only say in conclusion that, in the first place, women
do not take that strenuous interest in their labour conditions
which is essential to successful organisation. In the second
place, it appears that, except at occasional times of dispute,
their work is so well marked off from that of men, that the
men's Unions in these trades are coming more and more to the
conclusion that it does not pay them to organise the women.
In the third place, we have been surprised to find that the great
majority of employers and of their women employées assume
that wages are fixed and that any effort to alter them by organisation
will be doomed to failure.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Our investigators have been
given instance after instance of both increase and reduction in
wages, but the general tenor of conversation is a pessimist and
listless view that whatever <em>is</em>, is fixed.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>MEN AND WOMEN AS WORKERS.</i>
</span></h2>

<h4>
<span>Do women displace men?
</span></h4>

<p>One of the most important questions relating to women as
workers is the exact relationship between their work and that
of men, <i>i.e.</i>, how far they are rivals in competition
and how far they are helpers in co-operation. In
some of these trades, such as that of the lithographic
artists, this question has never arisen, because women have
rarely entered the trade. Only five instances of women working
as lithographic artists are known to the head of St. Bride's
Institute. But that men and women have been rivals from
time to time is placed beyond doubt, although it must always
be remembered that the same work nominally is not always the
same work actually.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_33" id="Footnote_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> Men feeders, for instance, carry formes and do little things about the
machine which women do not do. In one instance it was reported that a
firm with a London and a country house, employed women in the latter to
do binding done by men in the former. On enquiry it was found that the
heavy work was done in London and the light work in the country. An
interesting case in point is reported by a Scottish investigator. "Stated
that in another workshop a man had been displaced at a paper-ruling
machine and two girls taken on instead. I took special note of this case
when visiting the workshop in question later. There were two girls
employed at the machine, but they appeared to be working along with the
manager of that department, who was supervising it." But there is work,
such as the minding of platen machines which men do in London but
which women do in Edinburgh and Aberdeen.</p></div>

<p>Gold laying for cloth binding has, within the last quarter of
a century, become the work of women who have taken the
place of old "finishers" in some bookbinding firms,<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> Dunstable women are reported as doing binding throughout.
Women are employed as compositors much more frequently in
the provinces than in London. In Edinburgh and Aberdeen,
for instance, women are reported as being engaged in every
process, except making-up and the heavy work of carrying type,
in which men alone are employed. Type-setting and distribution
of type are often done by women in Scotland. In some
of the Edinburgh printing establishments women do practically
the same work as men. The extensive employment of women
during the compositors' strike in Edinburgh in 1872 to secure
a fifty-one hours' working week<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> was the result of the determination
of the employers to defeat the Typographical Association,
and at least one firm in London tried the same policy during
the bookbinders' strike for an eight-hours' day in 1902 though
apparently with no success. The enthusiasts for the introduction
of women into the printing trades had for some time been
trying to get a hold upon Edinburgh printing offices, but had
failed until the strike of 1872. An enterprising employer then
trained some girls from the Merchant Company's Schools&mdash;a
better class of girls whom we find described sometimes as
"stickit teachers"&mdash;to compose. The results were satisfactory,
and the example was speedily followed. The strike failed and
the displacement of men continued.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_34" id="Footnote_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> Reporting to their members in May, 1903, the Wages Committee of the
London Society of Journeymen Bookbinders (Third Report) state regarding
the award just given on certain points of dispute between the Unions and
the Employers: "The right of employment of women in laying-on of gold
has also been awarded against us, notwithstanding that no part of the
proceedings evoked more strenuous opposition from your representatives.
The hands of your delegates were weakened by the fact that the practice
already existed: in some cases had crept in, and in others been extended
unawares; yet they strove to preserve the right of the workman, whilst
willing and anxious that the supercession of the workwoman, where she had
been introduced, should be gradual and considerate.&mdash;The argument for the employers is that the employment of women on
the class of gold laying-on indicated, will enable them fairly to compete in
other fields, and will tend to increase men's work instead of to reduce it.
This view, the arbitrator adopted."</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_35" id="Footnote_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> So also in Aberdeen. "About a dozen years ago during a dispute about
apprentices, seventeen men and three or five boys went out, and girls were
then taken on."</p></div>



<h4>
<span>The Perth dispute.
</span></h4>

<p>Something similar happened in Perth, where twenty-five years
ago four girls were taken into the newspaper department of the
offices of the <cite>Perthshire Advertiser</cite>. About seven years
ago they were introduced into a commercial printing
office, and a year later the <cite>Perthshire Constitutional</cite> began to employ
them on general bookwork and setting-up newspaper copy,
the proprietor claiming that he had the same right as the other
offices to have cheap female labour. Thus the practice threatened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> to spread throughout the other commercial printing offices,
and the men's Union thought it was time to bestir itself.
It decided that the women must either be paid the same rates as
the men or be got rid of altogether. This ultimatum was sent to
the employers. The <cite>Constitutional</cite> complied with the demands of
the Union and dismissed its women workers. The <cite>Advertiser</cite> at
first proposed gradually to replace the girls by men in the commercial
department, but to continue to run the newspaper
department by female labour. The proprietor contended that
this would not give him an unfair advantage over the other
firms, as they employed linotype machines. The Union then
decided to strike, and took thirty men out of the <cite>Advertiser</cite>
office. Four remained in, and some other non-Union men were
also engaged. The office continues to work under this system.</p>



<h4>
<span>Value of women's work.
</span></h4>

<p>There has also been trouble in Grimsby (1899), owing to the
employment of women on a bi-weekly newspaper, at Redhill
(1898-1900), and at Reading (1902). Other places
where the Typographical Association report women
to be employed are, Louth (Lincolnshire), Aylesbury,
Beccles, Fakenham, Warrington,<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> etc.; whilst in Birmingham
the experiment was tried about 1890, but has been
abandoned. They are also employed at Bungay, but in
decreasing numbers, because their proofs require so much more
correcting than the men's that the valuable time thus lost is not
compensated for by the cheapness of their labour. The same is
true of Edinburgh, where their wages have fallen from a rate of
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> per average page. In Leicester a firm tried to
employ women in distributing type at low rates of pay, but a
protest from the local executive of the Typographical Association
led immediately to the experiment being discontinued.
There is an almost unanimous chorus of opinion that women's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> work as compositors is so inferior to men's that it does not pay
in the long run. From the days of Miss Faithfull's experiments,
the men have been able to boast that women could not touch
them at the case. In Aberdeen the unwillingness of boys to
submit to a long apprenticeship and the fear of parents that
the linotype has spoiled the typographical trade, are said to be
the main reasons necessitating the employment of women
compositors.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_36" id="Footnote_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> Women were introduced into Warrington newspaper offices early in the
decade beginning with 1880. They have been found to be quicker than men
in plain setting-up and simple straightforward work. They do not stay very
long&mdash;the eldest girl compositor employed, when our investigator called,
being only twenty-five. They are not employed in locking the formes;
nor curiously enough are they employed in the machine-room to feed the
printing presses, though they are so engaged in Manchester. The women
compositors are paid one-third of the men's rate. Here it was definitely
stated that the cheapness of women's labour made it unnecessary to
introduce linotypes.</p></div>


<h4>
<span>The men's view.
</span></h4>

<p>Men in these trades have never looked upon women competitors
with a friendly eye, the reason being that so many
branches are just on the margin line of those occupations
which are so light and easily picked up that
women can supplant men in them altogether.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The Typographical
Association for over a quarter of a century has had to
carry on a constant struggle with the employers in order to
protect the journeymen printers against three forms of cheap
labour&mdash;apprentices, unskilled men and women.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Employers
in a small way of business, maintaining establishments on little
capital, where efficiency is not high, employ women on work
done in larger and better equipped establishments exclusively
by men. Here there is rivalry and competition, and women
are preferred mainly because they accept lower wages, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> because they are not members of Unions;<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and their lack of
technical skill is not found to be a sufficient counterpoise to
these advantages. But in these places an inferior kind of work
is done, and if men were employed they would either have to
accept wages below the generally enforced scale, or the whole
character of the work and organisation of the business would
have to be changed.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_37" id="Footnote_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> It is interesting to note that an official of the Lithographic Printers'
Society, entitled to explain the attitude of the Union, stated, "The Lithographic
Society distinctly encourages girls; when boys feed the machines
they are apt to pick up too much and want to become litho-printers before
going through the apprenticeship. The women, not desiring to become
litho-printers, are better from the Society's point of view."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_38" id="Footnote_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> This is the real opposition which the men offer to women. In Perth
and Bungay, for instance, the women put in a bill at the end of each week,
worked out on the men's scale of rates. The cashier then divides the total
by two and pays the women accordingly. In Edinburgh women's piece rates
for composing average about two-thirds those of men. At Warrington, women
do machine-ruling for prices ranging from 15<i>s.</i> to 20<i>s.</i>, whilst men are paid
32<i>s.</i> for the same work. A more definite statement is made by a Manchester
employer. He estimated that a woman was two-thirds as valuable in a
printer's and stationer's warehouse as a man, and she was paid 15<i>s.</i> or 20<i>s.</i>
to his 33<i>s.</i> A further example of this is given in connection with a Scottish
firm executing Government work. "As the Government insists upon the
men's Union price being paid, the work is being done by men, although in
the ordinary way it would have been done by women." "But they would
never allow the women," said our informant of her employers, "to make
such big money as that."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_39" id="Footnote_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_39"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> This is why the Typographical Association offers a steady resistance to
the employment of women. It does not object to them as women, but as
forms of cheap and unskilled labour.</p></div>



<h4>
<span>Apparent rivalry.
</span></h4>

<p>In the better equipped houses, where women are employed
on work generally done by men, as in composing, only parts of
a compositor's duty are performed by women, and
the heavier or the more technical duties, such as
carrying about the formes or imposing, are done as a rule by
boys or men.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> So that here the rivalry is but partial, and,
moreover, the employment of women does not always pay.
It appears that in some cases, particularly in bookbinding,
the application of machinery<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> makes it possible for the less
skilled and lower paid women to do work formerly done by
men, so that men regard women <em>plus</em> the machine as their
competitor. On the other hand machines have displaced
women and have made new openings for men, as in the case of
one of the most recently introduced folding machines which
feeds itself. But the re-organisation of the workshop which
follows the introduction of the machine cannot be regarded
merely as a substitution of men's labour by women's or the
opposite, for what really happens is an all-round shifting of
the distribution of labour-power and skill, and a re-arrangement
of the subdivision of labour.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Men are transferred from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> one kind of work to another, owing mainly to a change in the
volume of production; women are introduced not so much to
take men's places as to fill places created by the re-organisation
of work; youths also find a footing more often at the expense
of women than of men. At certain points the machine
simplifies processes and abolishes the need of paying for skill
in the worker; at others it makes skill (sometimes, perhaps, a
new kind of skill) more necessary; at one point it abolishes
the need of paying for strength, at another it makes a new
opening for strength. Thus the displacement which occurs,
and the competition set up are often more apparent than real.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_40" id="Footnote_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> As a type of the reports from firms employing women compositors, the
following from Edinburgh firms may be summarised: Seven girls are
employed on each machine (monotype), five on the keyboards and two
correcting proofs. A man is kept for every ten or twelve girls, his work being
to "make up" the girls' work. Another firm employs a man to attend to
every three monotype machines used, for the purpose of keeping things
going. Another says it employs two men compositors and one labourer for
thirty-eight girls.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_41" id="Footnote_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> Machinery has also tended to increase the employment of women in
stamping and embossing.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_42" id="Footnote_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> An official of a Bookbinders' Union states: "In A works there was much
gloom among the men when the rounding and backing machine came in;
profitable work was taken away from the 'rounders' and 'backers,' but they
had more 'lining-up' and other work to do in consequence, so nobody was
turned off."</p></div>


<h4>
<span>A miscellaneous survey.
</span></h4>

<p>In the more miscellaneous trades over which this enquiry
ranged a considerable mass of evidence points to the displacement
of men by women. General statements to this
effect are common in the evidence of both employers
and employed. In firm A. it is alleged that women
do the same work in card mounting as used to be done by men,
and are paid 2<i>s.</i> for work which used to be paid for at 10<i>s.</i>
Paging and numbering used to be men's work, but is now almost
exclusively done by women. Plain relief stamping and black
bordering have also drifted into the hands of women, whilst
in various directions, such as the making and binding of cases,
wrappering, or feeding printing and particularly lithographic
machines, women are beginning to encroach upon men. These
displacements are very often only local. Manchester has one
experience; Edinburgh another. Leeds was agitated because
women were displacing men on a French ruling machine,
whilst elsewhere no similar move was taking place. But it
must be emphasised again that in many of these instances
careful enquiry shows that when men were employed they did
something that the women do not now do,<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and that the
employment of women was owing to an increased volume of
trade, when new machinery or some other change had made
a greater subdivision of labour possible and profitable. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> some cases girls displace boys for no other reason than that
boys cannot be found to do the work; this was the case in
Manchester some ten years ago, when girls took the place of
boys in letterpress work.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_43" id="Footnote_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> An Edinburgh employer put that in this way: "If women were paid
the same rates as men they would have to pay for their overseers and
assistants."</p></div>



<h4>
<span>Conclusions.
</span></h4>

<p>Generally, the results of our investigations show the following
summary of the advantages and disadvantages of women's
labour to the employer, and their employment in
preference to men depends upon how far in any
given case or under any given circumstances the balance of
these advantages and disadvantages is on the side of the
women&mdash;or, it must also be said, how far the employer is
bound by conservative use and wont so as to be protected
against any impulse to employ the best organisation for the
efficient conduct of his business.</p>

<p>The advantages of the woman worker are:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That she will accept low wages; she usually works for
about half the men's wages.</p>

<p>2. That she is not a member of a Union, and is, therefore,
more amenable to the will of the employer as the absolute rule
of the workshop.</p>

<p>3. That she is a steady<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> worker (much emphasis must not
be placed upon this, as the contrary is also alleged), and nimble
at mechanical processes, such as folding and collecting sheets.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_44" id="Footnote_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44"><span class="label">[44]</span></a> "In
 Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;'s youth, men used to do all the card mounting. Women
were introduced for it about twenty-nine years ago. They were brought in
because the men drank so and kept away." But later on the same informant
said that he had to introduce a varnishing machine because women "kept
away so."</p></div>

<p>4. That she will do odd jobs which lead to nothing.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_45" id="Footnote_45"></a><a href="#FNanchor_45"><span class="label">[45]</span></a> Birmingham boys, for instance, would not feed printing machines,
because it "leads to nothing," so girls were employed. <i>Cf.</i> Aberdeen,
p. 47, etc.</p></div>

<p>Her disadvantages are:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That she has less technical skill than a man, and is not
so useful all round.</p>

<p>2. That she has less strength at work and has more broken
time owing to bad health and, especially should she be married,
domestic duties, and that her output is not so great as that of
a man.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_46" id="Footnote_46"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46"><span class="label">[46]</span></a> An employer with considerable experience both of men and women in
the printing trade in Scotland, says, "given a certain area of floor space for
men and women, on the former would probably be produced half more than
on the latter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p></div>

<p>3. That she is more liable to leave work just when she is
getting most useful; or, expressing this in a general way, that
there are more changes in a crowd of women workers than in
a crowd of men workers.</p>

<p>4. That employers object to mixed departments.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_47" id="Footnote_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> 1, 2, and 4, together lead London employers to conclude that an
extension of women's employment is impossible, because it would mean
larger workshops in proportion to the numbers employed, and consequently
ruinous rents.</p></div>

<p>One interesting point must be noted in connection with
these conclusions. In London, where women mainly work on
the more unskilled and irregular processes, it is often difficult to
see what industrial influence they are exerting. In Edinburgh or
Aberdeen that is not so much the case. And one thing which
is observable in these places is that the employment of women of
itself leads to those minute subdivisions of labour characteristic
of machine industry. "There are more subdivisions of labour
amongst women than amongst men in the printing trade. For
example, one girl will set-up the type, another will "brassout"
(put in heads and finish it), or two may sometimes be
employed in finishing it."<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_48" id="Footnote_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> So in bookbinding. A Dundee manager of a general binding establishment,
says: "The subdivision of labour system has certainly favoured the
increased employment of women in the trade."</p></div>

<p>Cheap, mechanical and light work consequently tends to
be done by women, whilst the men enjoy almost undisputed
possession of the rest. The woman worker, for instance,
competes with the man in binding the cheap light notebook,
whilst she rarely interferes with him in binding heavy
ledgers.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> On the other hand, in some of the more mechanical
departments, such as examining sheets of paper by touch, she
attains a wonderful dexterity.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_49" id="Footnote_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> The following report from Aberdeen gives an interesting account of the
subdivision of labour in a firm which has introduced women for cloth-case
making:&mdash;"The department where girls are beginning to encroach on men is in
cloth-case work, that is, making the cases and putting them on. In the
higher reaches of the trade the women do not show themselves to be so
skilful. As yet the men's Unions have not shown much active opposition to
women's work in this branch, provided always that one man is set to work
with every five girls employed on it. The making of a 'case' is divided
into five sections and illustrates the modern development of the division of
labour system.</p>

<p>1st girl glues.</p>
<p>2nd girl lays on boards.</p>
<p>Man cuts corners.</p>
<p>3rd girl turns in ends.</p>
<p>4th girl turns in fore-edge.</p>
<p>5th girl (young) puts it through rolling machine."</p>

</div>

<p>We have also to note how very effectively
conservative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
notions about women's sphere and chivalrous prejudices about
protecting them, influence certain employers in determining
what work they <em>ought</em> to do.</p>


<h4>
<span>Technical training.
</span></h4>

<p>We have endeavoured to ascertain how far technical training
would increase the pressure of competition between men and
women, but in the present rudimentary state of such
training there are few data to guide us to any
very positive conclusion.</p>

<p>It is difficult, however, to see how in these trades the technical
training of women would threaten men, except perhaps in the
artistic branches. The use of the various mechanical typesetting
machines has already led to some displacement of
labour, and though the <i lang="la" xml:lang="fr">technique</i> of setting and spacing might
be taught to women in trade classes, the greater regularity of
the male worker, and his remaining longer at the trade must
always, in so skilled an industry as this, give him advantages
over his female competitor. Nor would classes for women in
bookbinding injure men bookbinders. For in this as in other
trades women are not handicapped only by a want of skill,
and if they attended classes, presumably they would be taught
chiefly the arts and crafts side of bookbinding, and thus be led
into branches of the trade at present undeveloped.</p>


<h4>
<span>"Use and wont."
</span></h4>

<p>Moreover, a curious fact has to be kept in mind. Women
workers are so lethargic that they are largely governed by use
and wont. No remark is more frequent in the
investigators' reports, than one to this effect, "That
is men's work. Why? We do not know, but it <em>is</em> men's work,
and we do not think about it." In some instances this use and
wont is based on experience; in others, as in the backwardness
of London employers in putting women to feed
 lithographic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
machines, its rational explanation is not obvious.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> In this
respect the women themselves are very "loyal." "Once the
employer wanted her," writes an investigator, "to varnish
books, and offered her 5<i>s.</i> a book: she has a steady hand and
could have done it quite well. It meant following a delicate
zig-zag pattern with a paint brush. She refused indignantly,
and said, 'I know my place and I'm not going to take men's
work from them.'" And, again, a rigid sense of propriety, based
on a certain amount of good reason, seems to determine many
employers to separate male from female departments without
further question.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_50" id="Footnote_50"></a><a href="#FNanchor_50"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> Except perhaps, as has been suggested, that the premises where lithographic
work is done are generally so unsuitable for the employment of
women.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_51" id="Footnote_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> A similar division exists in women's work; certain kinds are done by
women of an inferior social grade, <i>e.g.</i>, machine-feeding, and these are
strictly kept at arm's length by women working in different departments in
the same factory.</p></div>


<h4>
<span>Girls <i>v.</i> Women.
</span></h4>


<p>So much is heard of women as rivals of men that we forget
that women themselves are often preyed upon by still cheaper
rivals, and the real value of technical training for
women seems to lie in the fact that such training
might protect them against these. Owing to the unskilled
nature of their work, however, even technical education can
afford to them only an unsatisfactory security against younger
and cheaper persons. One of the investigators, for instance,
reports:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is the regular custom in A.'s now to have little girls at
3<i>s.</i> and 4<i>s.</i> a week doing work which women at 11<i>s.</i> and 12<i>s.</i>
ought to do. They put a little girl beside a regular hand,
and as soon as the little one masters the work [show-card
mounting is being reported upon], they discharge the big one.
When the little one asks for a rise, they give her 6<i>d.</i> or 1<i>s.</i>
more, and when she wants still more, she goes." Figures
follow showing that just under one-ninth of the women
employed in this department at A.'s are "old hands." Then
the report proceeds: "A. discharged about forty hands on the
plea of slackness a little while ago, and then put up bills for
learners." The investigators found that amongst the employées
there was a very widespread opinion that "the learners always
get all the best work," and that one of the regular features of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> the trade is, that it employs a large fluctuating number of
learners, whilst a smaller number of skilled hands are kept in
tolerably regular work.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_52" id="Footnote_52"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> This, however, is not a problem special to women's work, but is one of
general industrial conditions, although it is marked with special distinctness
in the case of women.</p></div>

<p>The old hands occasionally object to teach the young ones,
but nothing comes of their opposition to a system by which
they are compelled to train their own executioners.</p>

<h3>
<span>1. THE TRAINING.
</span></h3>

<h4>
<span>How girls are taught.
</span></h4>

<p>At the present moment such training as is given generally
begins in the workshops so soon as the girl has left school.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
Girls are, in the best houses, employed on the
recommendation of workers already there. Much
of the work, such as folding, is merely a matter of mechanical
quickness and accuracy, and after a few weeks' practice the
girl is as useful as she is ever likely to have an opportunity
to be. A great deal of the work women do in stationery
factories (such as stamping, black bordering, numbering pages)
is of a routine nature, and this work is generally paid by
the piece. For such departments, no premium is asked as
a rule.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>  Sometimes the beginner is paid a small wage&mdash;2<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i> or thereabouts&mdash;to encourage her at first. Sometimes
she works a few weeks for nothing.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Sometimes she has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> to pay a tuition fee to the woman under whose charge she
is put. Sometimes this woman gives her a small sum as a
gift in respect of the help she renders. Some firms make
the training period fairly long, in order that it may be impossible
for the lower class of girls to accept the conditions of
employment. By-and-by the learner is paid half of what
she earns, and finally she is put on regular piecework, her
advancement depending on her nimbleness. If she is in a
large house she is only taught one process, but if quick, and
employed in a smaller house, she may be taught several. In
almost every instance she is put upon piecework as soon as
possible after she begins. In an overwhelming number of cases
the beginners are simply placed beside a regular hand, and
pick up their skill by watching the old hand and then turning
and doing it themselves. The girl who "picked up
 vellum-sewing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
and wire-stitching" whilst engaged as a folder, and
she who was transferred from tie-making to stitching and
folding, are types. The phrase "serving her time" survives,
but the apprenticeship which is indicated hardly now exists.</p>

that the sum varied; in another well-known stationery firm a premium of £2
is asked for, but is returned with 5 per cent. interest at the end of three
years. The premiums of £50 or £100 charged by certain bookbinding
teachers are of course quite special.</p></div>

<p>LEADING EDUCATIONAL SUPPLY FIRM:</p>

<p><em>Copybook and
similar Work.</em>&mdash;"Has several little girls running about on errands
for a few shillings a week, and if any of them seem promising they are
helped on. Training nothing like what it used to be; girls learn only
one branch."</p>

<p>LARGE LONDON PRINTING FIRM:</p>

<p><em>Vellum-sewing
Department.</em>&mdash;"Regular apprenticeship still the system here."
Three years given as the period for training and during this time
no wages are paid. Girls come straight from school.
</p>

<p><em>Folding,
etc., Department.</em>&mdash;"No regular apprenticeship. Girls come in and
pick it up; if quick they are taught other branches, like numbering,
relief stamping, etc."</p>

<p>LONDON STATIONERY FIRM:</p>

<p><em>Envelope
Folding and Hand-cementing Department.</em>&mdash;"Girls are put under an
experienced party to whom they pay 10<i>s.</i> For six weeks, they receive
nothing. For next six weeks they receive half earnings, then they
are put on piecework."</p>

<p><em>Black Bordering.</em>&mdash;"A regular hand
teaches and gets any benefit of the work during six months in return
for the time she wastes in teaching." This practice is also adopted
in some firms in envelope folding by hand.</p>

<p>LONDON PUBLISHING FIRM:</p>

<p><em>Bookbinding Department.</em>&mdash;"System of indenture has
just been revived because it was found that otherwise the firm had no
hold over the girls, so that the quick ones as soon as they had learnt
went off elsewhere as full earners." Indenture for two years.</p>

<p>An
ex-forewoman in bookbinding, who knew the London trade well, stated
that much less trouble is taken with learners now than formerly. In
her own case she was apprenticed without indentures for two years, and
learned "all the branches right through," old work included.</p>

<p>Another
forewoman in work stated she was in training for four years: two years
at bookbinding, one year at vellum work, and one year at stationery.</p>

</div>


<p>Of the firms about which we have information for bookwork
and printers' folding, seven require a three years' training;
twenty, two years; thirty-three, one and a half years; nineteen,
one year; two, fifteen months; and seven, periods under
a year. Eleven firms have no settled apprenticeship time,
advancement depending entirely on the quickness of the learner.
In places where gold laying-on is done the same time is usually
served as for the other branches, <i>i.e.</i>, from a few weeks to
three years. In the case of vellum work, seven firms require
three years; eight, two years; three, one and a half years;
one, one and a half to two years; two, six months; and eight,
no settled time.</p>

<p>In some of these firms, however, a genuine attempt to teach
apprentices is made;<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and in at least one large and well-known
London house the system of indenture has been revived, owing
to the difficulty which was experienced in retaining girls after
they became competent. On the other hand, several wellknown
firms have ceased to employ learners because they are
too troublesome, and depend upon women trained elsewhere.
But we have found that in only a very few cases is the beginner,
whether an apprentice or not, thoroughly taught every process
of her trade. She is generally put to one process and kept at
it, so that the mechanical dexterity she may acquire is in no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
sense genuine trade skill.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> This distinction between trade
skill and mechanical dexterity in one process must be kept in
mind as a fundamental consideration in every problem concerning
the woman wage-earner.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_56" id="Footnote_56"></a><a href="#FNanchor_56"><span class="label">[56]</span></a> Apprenticeship
is still common in vellum-sewing where skill and
intelligence are required, and in places where women are doing more than
supplementary work, <i>e.g.</i> Edinburgh, a regular period of training varying
from two to four years is agreed upon. Apprenticeship seems to be most
common in Scotland. In London our investigation into vellum work,
printers' folding, and bookwork only discovered seven indentured women
apprentices, two of these being engaged in vellum work. Curiously enough
in paper-staining firms, although the processes are practically unskilled,
indentures are signed for two years; the girl receives 4<i>s.</i> a week for the first
year and a portion of her piece earnings for the second year. At the end of
two years she is a full wage-earner and is paid by piece rates. What her
earnings are it is difficult to discover; 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> was given as an average, but
this is probably too high. It is reported that she may make 6<i>d.</i> in less than
an hour when the colours are mixed and she is finishing a job, whereas next
day she will spend the whole morning before she earns her 6<i>d.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_57" id="Footnote_57"></a><a href="#FNanchor_57"><span class="label">[57]</span></a> <i>E.g.</i>, one of the large stationery firms in London reports regarding
machine ruling: "Girls come in and feed the machinery, and afterwards
rise to wet the flannel. They never mind the machines, <i>e.g.</i>, arrange pens
and so on." Another interesting note is, "Men nearly always do
illuminating, <i>e.g.</i>, stamping crests, etc., in more than one colour, on notepaper,
as the process requires more skill than women possess. If the
women did it, the ladies would not like their notepaper." An employer
defended the employment of women on the grounds of his own experience
of one woman who "had been working at a secret process for years, and
there is no fear of the secret being betrayed as she is without understanding
or interest for the machine."</p></div>

<p>The question of how much a girl learns during her time is a
vital one. Much depends on the forewoman. As one of the
workers put it, "How much you learn depends on the forelady,
and whether she takes a fancy to you; some girls will have a
turn at everything, others only learn sewing or folding. Dress
makes a great difference; the poorer you are, the less chance
you have of getting on."</p>

<p>The obverse of this from the forewoman's point of view is
that "girls if quick are taught all branches, but with some girls
it is all you can do to teach them one." It seems the general
opinion amongst all the older hands that the "training is not
what it used to be;" and, certainly, the few instances we have
come across of women who can do bookwork, vellum work,
and also stationery work, are amongst the older hands. The
complaint, however, that the trade was not properly taught,
occurs in the evidence given to the Commission of 1843, when
it seemed to be one of the principal grievances complained of.
Masters, it was said by one worker, often took girls, pretended
to teach them, and discharged them at the end of their time,
when they had to go elsewhere to learn. Three girls gave
evidence that they were tricked into serving from three to eight
months for nothing, and came away no wiser. At another shop
the employer expatiated on the thoroughness of the training
offered by him; but seven of his journeywomen, aged nineteen,
eighteen, seventeen, and sixteen, declared indignantly that they
had not learnt their business thoroughly, and would never have
gone to him if they had known his methods. The truth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> apparently is that in 1843, as to-day, some firms are better
for apprentices than others, and that a generation ago a
good firm doing general work offered better opportunities for
training than good firms conducted under up-to-date conditions
can now give.</p>

<p>The important point, however, is not so much the nominal
length of apprenticeship, but the fact that the work which an
"apprentice" now does is less educative than it was, and that
wage-earning considerations now enter at an earlier stage into
the apprentice's thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>



<h4>
<span>The learner as workwoman.
</span></h4>

<p>The low wages paid to learners offer great temptations to
employers to set these extra cheap workgirls upon certain
"fat" kinds of work. Some kinds of work,
<i>e.g.</i>, gathering, have thus come to be regarded as
learners' perquisites, and in one extreme instance a
worker made as much money when a learner on half pay as
she did subsequently on whole pay.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>These houses are engaged in various kinds of bookbinding and printing.</p>

</div>



<p>In several cases we have been able to trace the exact amount
gained by the employer:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. A. in the last sixteen weeks of her half-pay period made
£3 18<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, an average of 4<i>s.</i> 10¾<i>d.</i> per week. For the next
sixteen weeks, when a full hand, her average was 9<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i></p>

<p>2. B. in twenty-three weeks before she became a full hand
made £4 9<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>, or an average of 3<i>s.</i> 10¾<i>d.</i> per week. During
the next twenty-three weeks her average was 7<i>s.</i> 0-½<i>d.</i>, a few
pence less than double.</p>

<p>3. C. in fifty-one weeks made £15 5<i>s.</i> 4½<i>d.</i>, practically 6<i>s.</i>
per week; if on full wage, her average would have been
11<i>s.</i> 11½<i>d.</i></p>

<p>4. D. in thirty-seven weeks made £10 19<i>s.</i> 5½<i>d.</i>, practically
6<i>s.</i> per week; if on full wage her average would have been
11<i>s.</i> 10½<i>d.</i></p>

<p>5. E. in forty-seven weeks made £14 9<i>s.</i> 4½<i>d.</i>, or 6<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> per
week; if on full pay her average would have been 12<i>s.</i> 3¾<i>d.</i></p>

<p>6. F. in forty-three weeks made £12 12<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>, 5<i>s.</i> 1½<i>d.</i> per
week; if on full pay her earnings would have been 11<i>s.</i> 8¾<i>d.</i></p>

<p>It is obvious that when a worker is sufficiently expert to
make an average of 11<i>s.</i> or 12<i>s.</i> on full pay, it is a great
temptation to save on the bills by giving her as much work as
possible at half-price. The employer looks upon this profit as
the return made to him for teaching the girl, or, to speak
 more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
correctly, for allowing her to pick up the trade in his shop. It
really means that a heavy premium is being paid in instalments.
Possibly, when small fixed wages are paid, the employer's
profits are even higher, but in that case the learner has not
that temptation to sacrifice quality to quantity, and to be
content with "slapdash" work which is the inevitable consequence
of a piecework system worked under such conditions,
and which is specially injurious to the young hands.</p>


<h4>
<span>Compositors.
</span></h4>


<p>The training given to women compositors varies very much.
As is well known, boys are apprenticed to this trade for seven
years at wages which usually begin at 8<i>s.</i> a week,
and rise 2<i>s.</i> a year. In some cases, however, a
proportion of their piece-rate earning is given in addition.</p>

<p>When Miss Faithfull started the Victoria Press, girls were
indentured for four years, and paid a premium of ten guineas.
During the first six months they received nothing; for the
remaining three and a half years they were given two-third
piece rates. By 1869, when Mr. Head was running the business,
this system had been changed. In an article in the
<cite>Printers' Register</cite> for October 6th, 1869, we read that at the
Victoria Press, apprenticeship, "a relic of the ignorance and
shortsightedness of our forefathers, which is maintained in our
own day chiefly by the prejudices of Trades Unions, is entirely
abolished. Girls begin to earn at once," with the consequence
that the work is much better. The Women's Printing Society
started with an apprenticeship of three or four years, the wages
rising from 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 10<i>s.</i></p>

<p>At the present time the training varies in different houses, from
one where the girls are regularly indentured for four years, pay
a premium of £5, and receive 4<i>s.</i> for the first year and 5<i>s.</i>, 6<i>s.</i>,
7<i>s.</i> a week in the ensuing years, to one where, with a premium
of three guineas, the training lasts for three months only, and
the worker is put on piecework after that period.</p>

<p>Two women compositors who had served for four years gave
it as their opinion that two years were sufficient to learn; during
the remaining years "you are expected to do as much as a full
hand and get only half wages."</p>

<p>It is obvious, however, that much depends on the amount of
work taught, and the complaint is reiterated over and over
again that girls will only learn the easy, plain work: "they
want to make money at once."</p>

<h4>
<span>Women and technical classes.
</span></h4>


<p>Enquiries were addressed to the Secretaries of Technical
Education Committees in every town in the kingdom
where the printing and kindred trades are of any
importance, asking&mdash;</p>

<p>"1. Whether, in connection with your technical and other
schools, any provision is made for the training of women in the
bookbinding or in any of the printing or stationery trades;</p>

<p>"2. Whether the classes have been attended by any numbers
of women; and</p>

<p>"3. Whether you have received at any time from employers
statements showing the effect of such classes upon these
trades?"</p>

<p>Seventeen replied that no provisions were made, six that the
matter was under consideration, but only in one case was it
stated that classes had been opened, and then the women had
not taken advantage of them. The London County Council
Technical Education Board has had only one application (to
which it could not accede <a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>) from a woman who desired to attend
bookbinding classes.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_59" id="Footnote_59"></a><a href="#FNanchor_59"><span class="label">[59]</span></a> The woman was an amateur who had no connection with the trade, and
the Board refused admission on that ground. See this Board's Special
Report on Technical Instruction of Women.</p></div>

<p>This shows that in these trades the school, so far as women
are concerned, has not yet been brought into contact with the
workshop. Nominally the classes are open to women actually
engaged in the trade, but women do not attend. This seems to
be partly owing to the attitude of the men, and partly owing to
the lack of interest on the part of the woman worker in the few
facilities afforded to her by Technical Education Committees.</p>

<p>The Home Arts and Crafts Association and kindred movements
have taught women amateurs bookbinding and leather
work in a good many centres, but this training has had no
general industrial effect. The Association for the Employment
of Women has offered facilities for the training of women in
working the linotype, but it has met with but scanty response.
"It is work which needed more skill," said one employer, "than
women possessed."<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_60" id="Footnote_60"></a><a href="#FNanchor_60"><span class="label">[60]</span></a> We have heard since this was written that women are employed on linotype
machines in a prosperous provincial newspaper and general printing office.</p></div>

<p>Here again we have had evidence of the most conclusive
nature to show that the work of women is special in
its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
simplicity, and that the craftswoman is hardly to be found
anywhere. And they seem to have accepted the position, and
make no attempt to move out of it.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_61" id="Footnote_61"></a><a href="#FNanchor_61"><span class="label">[61]</span></a> This note is typical of a good many which occur in the reports of the
investigators. "There are two girls now on the black-bordering machine
whom the forewoman has offered to teach to place out by hand, but they
won't learn it; it is too much trouble."</p></div>



<h3>
<span>2. WHY WOMEN DO NOT TRAIN.
</span></h3>

<p>Some explanation is required for the fact that women have
so little ambition to become skilled, especially seeing that their
lack of technical knowledge and their willingness to remain at
work which is merely mechanical, <i>i.e.</i>, folding, etc., explain their
low wages, casual employment, and careless organisation.</p>


<h4>
<span>Marriage as an industrial influence.
</span></h4>

<p>The physiological differences between men and women have
sociological results. These differences have no doubt been
exaggerated and emphasised by traditions of propriety,
and the change of opinion indicated generally
by the expression, "the woman movement," has
done a great deal to bring down those differences to their
natural proportions and relations. If certain claims of equality,
such as women's suffrage, were generally accepted, men and
women might tend to occupy a much more equal industrial
status. But when all false emphasis and exaggeration have
been removed, a considerable residuum of difference must
remain.</p>

<p>The special status of the married woman will no doubt survive
all readjustment of traditional modes of thought, and will tend
to withdraw her mind from the steady pursuit of industrial
efficiency, because she will never consider wage earning to be
her special task in the world. That has tempted her hitherto
to steer off from the currents in the mid-stream of industrial
life, and float upon those that flow more sluggishly by the
margin. Hence she has entered industry, not with expectations
of long employment, but with hopes of a speedy release, and
she has therefore been in haste to earn money at once, and
unwilling to sink capital (either in time or money) in making
herself efficient. She is found in the more mechanical and
more easily acquired branches of work, and also in those which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>provide no future for men,<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and her willingness to take low
wages has been her great protection against competing
machinery. She has preferred to remain incompetent. "Out
of twenty-six girls," is the report from the manager of a well-known
firm for high-class artistic bookbinding, "not one could
he trust as a forewoman."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_62" id="Footnote_62"></a><a href="#FNanchor_62"><span class="label">[62]</span></a> An interesting illustration of this is afforded by the recent employment
of women in typefounding in London. London has not been a place
where women were much employed in this industry. For twenty or thirty
years girls have been employed in Edinburgh typefoundries, at certain
processes through which the type, when cast, has to go, but they have been
introduced only within the last year or two in London, to take the place of
boys who could not be got because the work offers no very satisfactory
prospects for them, and because the introduction of the linotype and mono-type
threatens the future of the typefounding industry. <i>Cf.</i> Aberdeen,
p. 47, Manchester and Birmingham, p. 50.</p></div>


<h4>
<span>The lack of openings and ambition.
</span></h4>

<p>Moreover, this enquiry has shown that there is but little
chance for women in these trades to improve themselves.
Openings for responsible employment are few, and
the ambition of the woman is not stirred by the
possibility of material improvement as the reward
of skill and industry. When responsible places become vacant,
it is sometimes difficult to get women to consent to fill them.
They seem to have little of that divine discontent which is the
mainspring of progress. "They never ask for a rise as a man
would, ... though after a time when they are useful, the firm
would be quite willing to give one." "He finds that girls want
to earn a certain wage. As a rule they will not take less, and
they don't trouble to earn more."  A Manchester correspondent
reports: "There is very little chance of rising, and no particular
desire for it, on the part of the ordinary girl, whose main
aspirations are otherwise directed."</p>

<p>Reporting generally on her enquiries, an investigator writes:
"The progressive young woman, eager to show that she is
man's equal and can do man's work, seems to be a product of
the middle classes. I never met girls with ambitions of that
sort among the employees I talked with. On the other hand, I
have met with cutting reproofs from forewomen and others in
the bookbinding houses when I tried, in my innocence, to find
out why they did not turn their hands to simple and easy processes
which were being done by men. 'Why, that is man's
work, and we shouldn't think of doing it!' is the usual answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
given with a toss of the head and a tone insinuating that there
is a certain indelicacy in the question." Another investigator
reports: "In a paper-staining department an attempt was once
made to have a forewoman instead of a foreman over the girls,
but she was not successful in watching the colours and had to
be replaced by a man. The employer in consequence came to
the conclusion that such a feat was beyond a woman's power,
and the workers themselves are of the same opinion and scorn
the idea of a forewoman."</p>



<h4>
<span>Sex reputation.
</span></h4>

<p>Women in slowly increasing numbers seem to be settling
down to a thorough industrial training, but except when they
start businesses of their own, the general reputation
of woman as workers, especially their liability to
marry and leave, must permanently handicap the most efficient
in search of employment.</p>

<p>Even the woman who has paid a premium of £50 or £100
for thorough instruction in the art of bookbinding is warned
that "a worker cannot be taken on anywhere, but has to set up
on her own account," and even then she often does not enter
the regular open competitive market, but attaches certain
customers to herself, owing to her special work.</p>

<p>The exceptional woman will always have to bear the burden
of the average woman.</p>

<p>The questions put to employers upon this point received very
emphatic replies: "It does not pay us to train women," they
said in some form or another; "We only want them for simple
processes such as folding, and if we tried to make them skilled
in more complicated work they would leave us before we got
the same return for our trouble as we get from men."</p>


<h4>
<span>Physique, hours, etc.
</span></h4>


<p>The low standard of women's living also diminishes their
stamina and strength, and though in the course of this enquiry
we have not discovered any very serious complaint
that women were irregular at their work owing to ill-health
(a common complaint against women in offices), yet the
drawback has been mentioned.</p>

<p>Moreover, it must be noted that when a girl's work in the
workshop is finished she has often to go home to commence a
new round of domestic tasks from which a boy is exempted.
This aggravates the seriousness of her long hours of mechanical
work as a wage-earner, and increases the difficulties placed in
her way should she desire to attend evening technical classes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
The directors of several educational institutions and the teachers
of technical classes for women have strongly urged this point
upon us.</p>

<p>We have to face the fact that, for various reasons, in modern
industrial society there is of necessity a tendency to specialise
the work of men and women and centre the one in the workshop
and the other in the home, and to incline women to take
a place in industry second to their male relations. Hence, in
the workshop women have hitherto been adjuncts to machines;
they have taken up simple mechanical processes, and have
shown little interest in complete series of industrial operations.
They have picked up the arts, but have shunned the sciences.
The factory and the workshop have been to them the scenes of
"meanwhile" employment.</p>


<h4>
<span>Gentility in trade.
</span></h4>


<p>In such circumstances one is not surprised to find such considerations
as conventional gentility determining the branches
of trade taken up by the women. The printing trades generally do not attract the most genteel girls,
but there are grades within them. One informant says, "In
Manchester, up to 1870, to be a folder was looked upon as
being next door to being on the streets;" but now folders look
down upon feeders. "Folding and sewing girls look down on
the machine girls tremendously, and would not sit at the same
table with them for anything." Perhaps the manager who said
in a shocked tone of voice that "The women never care to talk
of the Sunday's sermon" was hypercritical, but undoubtedly
certain sections of these trades are staffed by rather rough
specimens of women.</p>

<p>Then again, a folder, despised herself by those above her, is
reported to "look down upon the litho and bronzing girls.
They are of the very lowest class (she says), with hardly a shoe
on their feet. They are on quite a different floor and have
nothing to do with the folders." Or again, for reasons of
gentility, girls prefer to become book-folders, where the hours
are longer and the pay lower, rather than to become paper-bag
makers. The distinction between these various sections is not
similar to that between skilled and unskilled labour. The simple
explanation is that amongst women engaged in industry convention
is particularly potent in determining what trades are desirable
and proper and what are not, so that when certain employments
acquire a reputation for gentility, the others
will be filled by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
goodly proportion of unassorted girls, and will ultimately
acquire characteristics which appear to justify the feminine
prejudices against them. It has been suggested that these
notions of gentility have, as a matter of fact, a deeper significance,
and that the favoured trades are the lighter ones. To
some extent this is true. The heavier employments are staffed
by a rougher class of women. But, as in the case of the
Manchester folders cited above, fashions change, and we must
recognise that reputation for gentility is a very important
factor in determining the distribution of character amongst the
trades. This appears to be the main reason why high wages
do not always attract the better class of girls to certain kinds
of employment, and also why there is a reluctance on the
part of many self-respecting girls to enter a course of industrial
training.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>LEGISLATION.</i>
</span></h2>

<h3>
<span>1. THE LAW.
</span></h3>

<p>The printing and allied trades were not brought within the
scope of legislation until Mr. Walpole's Factory Acts' Extension
Act of 1867.</p>


<h4>
<span>Conditions of employment, 1866.
</span></h4>

<p>The Commission on Children's Employment in 1866<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> first
disclosed the fact that substantial abuses prevailed throughout
the printing and kindred trades. Long hours,
frequent nightwork, Sunday labour, irregularities
regarding meal times, and insanitary conditions&mdash;such,
roughly speaking, were the hardships which made it
desirable to bring them under State supervision. Mr. Lord,
who took an active part on these Commissions, said that the
general state of printing houses in London was very bad; not
only were the composing rooms generally overcrowded and ill-ventilated,
but even machine rooms were often extremely dirty,
close and unhealthy. He cites the case of a machine room,
where the roof was so low that a hole was cut in the ceiling for
the head of the boy who was "laying-on" to go through.
"The heat of steam printing," says he, "is very deleterious in
close cellars, such as many places in this town are."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_63" id="Footnote_63"></a><a href="#FNanchor_63"><span class="label">[63]</span></a> Children's Employment Commission, 1862-1866 (Report V.).</p></div>

<p>Speaking of the factories of wholesale stationers, the same
witness says, "Many of the workrooms are ill-ventilated and
overcrowded. The cubical contents of one large room
measured by me were 136 ft. per head; those of another only
87 ft. per head."</p>

<p>With regard to hours, the Commissioners report: "These
ordinary hours (viz., 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. for females, 7 a.m. to
9 p.m. for men and boys) are from time to time exceeded to the
extent of one or two hours, and sometimes more. In the case
of those who bind for publishing houses the four or five winter
months are the busy season, and the six weeks immediately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> preceding Christmas those of the greatest pressure; at one such
place work often continued from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. in those six
weeks. The 'push' of 'magazine day' also affects this trade
as it does the printer, keeping the workpeople for several days
at the end of each month until 10 or 11 p.m., and on rare
occasions till 1 or 2 a.m. The case of railway guides is even
worse than that of magazines, for females sometimes have to
work the whole night through till 6 a.m., returning to work at
10 on the same morning, and when the first of a month is on a
Monday, work the whole of the preceding Sunday. On Sunday,
April 30th this year, at one place twenty females worked from
10 a.m. to 8 p.m., and after a rest of two hours went on again
through the night. Even girls of thirteen had worked in the
same week once from 4 a.m. to 10 p.m., and twice from 9 a.m.
to 10 p.m. Another rather older (fourteen and a half) worked
on one day from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. and on the preceding day
from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. A boy aged fourteen had worked two
or three times in a week from 7 a.m. to 10 or 11 p.m. and three
Sundays through."</p>

<p>"With paper-box makers," the Commissioners say, "it is
not uncommon to make two or even three hours overtime (this
after a day of from 9 a.m. to 8 or 9 p.m.). For two months in
spring and six weeks in autumn fourteen hours is the usual
length of a female's working day. At one place females over
fifteen are said to work constantly in the busy time from 9 a.m.
to 12 p.m., and in some places till 1 or 2 a.m., especially with
'little men' working at home with their family and two or
three girls to help. These are instances of London work, but
in Manchester the hours are even longer. One girl worked, at
sixteen years old, night after night in succession, from 6 a.m. to
12 p.m.; the younger ones there worked from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m.;
at another place the same witness had frequently worked from
6 a.m. to 10 p.m. Another, at nine years old, worked from
8 a.m. to 9 p.m. generally; she said that the older ones worked
a good deal later than that. Some young women had worked
on three or four occasions all the night through."</p>

<p>"Boys of fourteen and fifteen employed at making cardboard,
have in some cases worked from 8 a.m. till 10 or 11 p.m. twice a
week for four or five weeks running, but that is not general in
the trade. Girls of that age have worked at making paper
bags nearly every night for a similar period, till 10 or 11
p.m.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
from 8 a.m., and were very much tired by it. As paper-box
making is all handwork and paid for by the piece, it is not
uncommon for work to go on in the meal hours&mdash;'they please
themselves.'"</p>

<p>The following was the experience of one girl which she gave
before the Commissioners. "I am thirteen; I have been here
twelve months. Some of the girls worked all night last month
for two nights together. I call 'till 4 in the morning' all night.
We generally work one night till 4 a.m., and three or four
nights till 12. My mother thought all night hurt me and so
would not let me go on, but I work till 12. Last month I
worked five times in the night till 12. It is only in that week;
we get very tired towards the end of it."</p>

<p>With regard to the moral conditions of the workers the
Commissioners reported: "The indiscriminate mixing of the sexes
which still prevails in many workrooms is generally condemned.
The evil of such a practice is especially conspicuous where they
are late and irregular in their hours. The bad language and
conduct of the boys is made the subject of very strong comment
by two witnesses, who go so far as to say that there is a marked
deterioration in this respect during the last ten years."</p>

<p>Again, "The younger children were in many cases unable to
read. The evil of late and irregular work in letting women
loose on the streets at all hours of the night is justly censured
by an employer as necessarily leading to great immorality."</p>


<h4>
<span>Legislation, 1867.
</span></h4>

<p>In consequence of the Report of the Commissioners, the Factory
Act Extension Act, 1867, was passed. It applied specifically
to any premises where paper manufacture, letter-press
printing and bookbinding were carried on; and
generally to any premises where fifty or more people were
employed in any manufacturing process. The hours allowed
for women and young persons were from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., or
from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., with intervals amounting to one and a half
hours for meals; on Saturday, work had to cease at 2 p.m.
By way of exception, women employed in bookbinding could
work fourteen hours a day, provided that their total hours did
not exceed sixty per week.</p>

<p>To those trades, such as litho-printing, that did not come
under the above Act, was applied the Workshops Regulation
Act of the same year, the provisions of which resembled, though
they did not coincide with those of the foregoing
enactment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
The same aggregate number of hours per day and week was
established, but more elasticity was permitted in workshops,
women and young persons being allowed to work in them for
the hours specified at any time between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m., and
until 4 p.m. on Saturdays.</p>


<h4>
<span>Factory and Workshop Act, 1878.
</span></h4>

<p>The discrepancies in the regulations applying to different
classes of work were productive of a good deal of inconvenience,
and after the Commission of 1876 came the Factory
and Workshop Act, 1878, having as its object the
consolidation and amendment of the existing statutes
with a view to rendering their administration more
even and secure. The main provisions of the law as it now
affects the printing and kindred trades were laid down, although
since that date there have been various additions and amendments.
By this Act a distinction was drawn between factories
and workshops, the chief difference being that, in the former,
machinery propelled by steam, water, or other mechanical power
must be in use; while in the latter, no such agency must be
employed. Certain classes of works, however, apart from all
question of mechanical power, were defined as factories and not
workshops. Under these came paper-staining works, foundries
(including typefoundries), except premises in which such process
was carried on by not more than five persons, and as subsidiary
to the repair or completion of some other work&mdash;paper mills,
letter-press printing works, and bookbinding establishments.</p>


<h4>
<span>Factory and Workshop Act, 1901.
</span></h4>

<p>As regards hours of work and overtime, slight modifications
have been effected by legislation subsequent to the year 1878,
and the present state of the law as laid down in the
Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, is as follows:&mdash;The
regular hours for women and young persons
except Saturday, are 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., or
8 a.m. to 8 p.m., with an allowance of one and a half hours for
meals, one hour of such meal-time being before 3 p.m. On
Saturday the period of employment may be 6 a.m. to 2 p.m.,
7 a.m. to 3 p.m., or 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., with not less than half-an-hour
for meals. But where a woman or young person
has not been actually employed for more than eight hours on
any day in a week, and notice of this has been affixed in the
factory or workshop and served on the inspector, she may be
at work on Saturday from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m., with an interval of
not less than two hours for meals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>There are various special restrictions and exceptions applying
to different classes of work. No protected person may take a
meal or remain during meal-time in any part of a factory or
workshop where typefounding is carried on, or where dry
powder or dust is used in litho-printing, playing-card making,
paper-staining, almanac-making, paper-colouring and enamelling.
In certain industries, including printing, bookbinding,
machine ruling and envelope making, women may work three
days a week, and for thirty days during the year, two hours
overtime, provided that such employment ceases at 10 p.m.,
and that they have two hours for meals. But this limit of
overtime applies to the factory or workshop as a whole, and
not to the overtime of individual workers.</p>



<h3>
<span>2. ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL EFFECTS OF LEGISLATION.
</span></h3>

<p>The foregoing brief summary of the law has naturally preceded
the question as to how far legislation has affected women in
these particular trades. When restrictions are imposed upon the
labour of any class of wage-earners, their economic position
must be altered for good or evil, unless the trade can so adjust
itself as to meet exactly the requirements of these restrictions.
If the worker is of great importance, an effort will be made to
adapt the trade to the novel conditions; if another class of
workers or machinery, free from all restrictions, can be as easily
used, it is probable that the labour affected will be ousted.</p>


<h4>
<span>Has legislation displaced women?
</span></h4>

<p>Is there, then, evidence to show that any material displacement
of women or girls in these trades followed the enforcement
of factory legislation? Instances of dismissal must
obviously be sought for soon after the Act of
1867, as the employer then knew on what terms he
engaged his staff, and, except in a few cases where
deliberate evasions of the law might be attempted, the effect of
legislation would be to deter him from employing women,
rather than lead him to dismiss them. Owing to the lapse of
time, it is difficult to find out from those in the trade the
immediate consequences of this Act, nor does the Commission
of 1876 give much assistance. Of 103 employers questioned
by us, not half a dozen remembered dismissing women in
consequence of the new enactment.</p>

<p>One employer turned off ten or twelve women "folders"
 and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
introduced machinery, alleging as his reason the want of elasticity
in the Factory Act. His ordinary hours were from 8 a.m.
to 8 p.m., but on certain days in the week it was necessary to
begin work at 6 a.m. He made arrangements that the total
number of hours should not exceed those sanctioned by the Act,
but the variation was not allowed. If his women began work
at 6 a.m. on any day, his hours had to be regularly 6 a.m. to
6 p.m., except in the case of thirty nights in the year when
overtime was permitted. As this did not suit his business, he
dismissed the women and had recourse to folding machines.
Personally he gained, as the machinery proved an economy,
but it told hardly on the women, whom otherwise he would
have kept on as they were old hands.</p>

<p>Another employer told a similar tale regarding the introduction
of folding machinery, but stated that he had been obliged to
dispense with female operatives by reason of the strict enforcement
of the regulations regarding overtime only.</p>

<p>In both these cases it is clear that the state of the trade was
such that it required only a very slight disability on the part of
the worker to make it worth while for the employer to use
machinery.</p>

<p>Quite apart from any effect of legislation the machine was
destined to supplant manual labour; its advent was merely
accelerated by the Act. Its first introduction caused isolated
cases of hardship, but its ultimate results were beneficial. Thus
at the present day women and girls are largely employed upon
the very machines which once seemed to threaten their industrial
existence.</p>


<h4>
<span>The case of women compositors.
</span></h4>

<p>In the <cite>Economic Journal</cite> of 1899 an interesting paper by Miss
Bradby and Miss A. Black discusses the position of women
compositors in Edinburgh, and deals with the subject
of legislation. After an exhaustive investigation, no
single instance was discovered of the displacement of
a woman by a man owing to the Factory Acts.</p>

<p>The chief contention of those who oppose special factory
legislation on the ground that it limits the usefulness of women
compositors is, that women are not employed on newspaper
work, and they give the legal prohibition of nightwork for
women as the reason. Careful enquiry has shown that reason
to be purely imaginary. Women are not employed on evening
papers, though the factory law does not stand in their
 way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
In the provinces women set-up one or two weekly or bi-weekly
journals, the firms employing them preferring them solely on
the ground of cheapness. Experience shows that women are
not suited for newspaper work, unless the paper does not appear
more frequently than, say, twice a week, and if the factory code
disappeared to-morrow, morning daily newspapers would afford
to women compositors no fresh openings.</p>


<h4>
<span>Have their opportunities been limited?
</span></h4>

<p>As regards the further point whether more women
would be employed if they were unprotected by law,
the views of representative employers and managers
of labour are here set forth.</p>

<p>Out of thirty-five,<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> twenty-eight were emphatic in their
assurance that the Factory Acts did not affect the question.
Seven, on the other hand, were inclined to think otherwise.
Of these, five were unable to say that they really would employ
more women if freed from restrictions, but two of them thought
that "there might be something in it," though the point had
"never occurred to them before." Only three of them were of
the opinion emphatically that legislation was certainly one
amongst the obstacles to the employment of women.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_64" id="Footnote_64"></a><a href="#FNanchor_64"><span class="label">[64]</span></a> These are the firms interviewed by Miss Bradby and Miss A. Black as
above.</p></div>

<p>When, on the other hand, we turn to the opinions of those
acquainted with the conditions of the trade, either as workers
(chiefly women) or Trade Union officials, we find practical
unanimity. The eighteen persons<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> of this description questioned
were strong in their declarations that the employment of women
was not affected by the Factory Acts. To most of them, indeed,
the idea of any harmful connection between the two was novel
and ridiculous. This of course proves nothing; but if legislation
had, to any considerable extent, hampered the work of women,
the women themselves would doubtless have become aware of it.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_65" id="Footnote_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_65"><span class="label">[65]</span></a> Compositors only.</p></div>

<p>The evidence available leads to the conclusion that, except
in a few small houses, the employment of women as compositors
has not been affected by the Factory Acts.</p>



<h4>
<span>Legislation and home work.
</span></h4>

<p>The earlier stages during which the protection conferred
by the Legislature was enforced, were marked by
attempts on the part of certain employers to evade
the spirit of the law by means of home work.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p></div>

<p>One example of this practice was given by the Rev. H. W.
Blunt in his evidence before the Commission of 1876. He says
that much work was sent to be completed after factory hours.
For instance, in one book-folding firm which had occasional
rushes of work, a girl was employed till 11 p.m. on the
Monday before Christmas. She was then told with the other
girls that they must take home 1,000 quarto sheets to fold by
the morning. Several did so, but she refused, because her
mother was on the point of death, and the doctor said there
must not be a light in the room. She was consequently
dismissed at once. Mr. Blunt says further that religious
"weeklies," the sheets of which came off the press at 12 o'clock
at night, were sent out to be folded by 8 a.m. They were taken
away in perambulators, children being employed to do this
every week.</p>


<h4>
<span>Work sent to "folding houses."
</span></h4>

<p>Another immediate result of legislation was the expedient of
sending out work to "folding houses" which did not come
within the definition of a factory or workshop. Such
places may be premises belonging to a factory and
yet separate from it. Mr. Henderson, of the Factory
Department, in giving evidence before the Commission of 1876,
says: "Some years ago I came across Messrs. X., where newspapers
were folded wholesale by steam machinery, and I
thought it was a factory. Messrs. X. resisted the idea. Boys
were employed at irregular hours, but the Crown officers
decided that it was not a factory." Christmas card packing
and sorting are in the same position. Miss Deane, a lady
factory inspector, who made a special investigation into the
conditions of the Christmas card industry as recently as 1899,
points out that many of the workplaces are outside the
operation of the Act.</p>

<p>In the Report on Factories and Workshops for 1899, she
says: "A large number of Christmas cards, almanacs, etc.,
are made in Germany and are sent to England, where girls
are employed in sorting and repacking and arranging them,
for the purpose of being sold wholesale. Such places, unless
attached to some factory or workshop, being unregulated by the
Act, the girls are without the protection afforded by the law
regarding length of hours, meal-times, etc. It was impossible
not to be struck by the difference between the conditions found
in one such place and those found in the large airy
sorting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
rooms of a publishing factory close by&mdash;yet the girls in the
stuffy workroom of the former were without the protection
given by the law in the latter workplace. A curious instance
arose in connection with one such place where about forty girls
had been employed in packing and sorting for illegal hours.
The occupier took to employing some of them in affixing
a minute bow of ribbon to the cards, and during this temporary
employment all the girls could claim and were accorded the
protection of the Factory Acts. Excessive hours in hitherto
unsuspected workrooms were also found to be worked in the
processes of adapting and preparing bonbons for sale. In some
cases, baskets, boxes and bags, were trimmed for the reception
of these articles, in others they were merely selected and
arranged in patterns in fancy boxes subsequently tied up with
ribbon. In the first case clearly, and in the last also probably,
the definition of workshop under the Act applies. Instructions
were given and better conditions have gained the day." Speaking
of these unregulated workplaces, in the same report, Miss
Deane remarks: "In the course of some inspections after
midnight last winter near the City, I came across several of
these workplaces where women, girls and children, were then
at work under deplorable conditions&mdash;dirty rooms, foul, gassy
air, and overcrowding. In one of them I was met by the
observation that 'I might come in if I liked, but I could do
nothing there.'"</p>

<p>The experience of two of our investigators corroborates the
above statement. One of them says: "At about 2.45 a.m. we
went to see newspapers folded by women in the City. It was done
in an old tumble-down room opposite a printing shop. We
peeped in through a chink in the shutters&mdash;it was a boiling
night, and the shutters were closed&mdash;and we could see a man
carrying in a load of paper from time to time. When we entered
we found four women streaming with perspiration in the foul hot
atmosphere, folding away at the ... <cite>News</cite>. They were quite
friendly and communicative, and told us they came every
Thursday night about 11 p.m. and stayed till they had done.
They were paid three times as much as day-workers and did
no regular work in the daytime. Before beginning work they
had a cup of tea. They said they liked the work and were
glad that the Factory Act could not stop them; the police had
been round to them and also two young ladies, but nothing
 had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
happened; and they considered that they were quite old enough
to do nightwork if they liked."</p>

<p>Folding houses are growing fewer in number owing, no
doubt, to the fact that rent is so high in the City and space so
valuable, that it is not worth while to erect them separate from
a factory. Viewed also with dislike by factory inspectors as a
means of evading the law, their tenure of life is not likely to
be long.</p>


<h4>
<span>Nightwork.
</span></h4>

<p>Employers admit that the effect of the Factory Acts has
been to make them reduce nightwork. In criticising the
Act before the Commission of 1876, Mr. Bell, of the
firm of Darton, Bell and Thomas, bookbinders, says:
"The Factory Act of 1867 has been a boon to employers
and employed, because it has enabled us to put pressure on
customers. Now we can say to the public 'We can't go beyond
certain hours,' and, therefore, work not new has to be sent
in earlier."</p>

<p>Mr. Darton, of the same firm, adds: "We have persuaded
booksellers to give out stock work in June and July instead of
September or October, and so begin the work earlier and avoid
nightwork." This stimulus is undoubtedly good, and these
views are echoed by other employers.</p>

<p>The whole question of how far the practical prohibition of
overtime for women has limited the volume of work available
for them, and thus diminished their aggregate wages, needs very
careful consideration, as mistaken conclusions may easily be
formed. The matter was carefully considered by a Committee
of the Economic Section of the British Association, appointed
in 1901, to enquire into the effect of special legislation on
women, and the following extracts from its final report<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> are of
some interest:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A very important, perhaps from the economic point of view
the most important, effect of legislation has been to spread the
period of work more uniformly through the week, month, and
year than had been the case before regulation" (p. 5).</p>

<p>"The tendency to put off giving orders to the last moment is
easily checked when the customer can be met with a universal
legal prohibition" (p. 7).</p>

<p>"Restriction is met by adaptation of manufacture or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> rearrangement of numbers employed and time at which work
is done, women being still employed at the work" (p. 13).</p>

<p>"Except for a few complaints as to the abolition of the
possibility of payment for overtime, which, as has been pointed
out, by no means prove any loss of earnings ... the Committee
have no record ... of any loss of wages or earnings traceable
to the [Factory] Acts" (p. 25).</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_67" id="Footnote_67"></a><a href="#FNanchor_67"><span class="label">[67]</span></a> Presented at Southport in 1903.</p></div>

<p>Thus, it will be seen that the loss of overtime is not necessarily
a loss of work, but a re-distribution (and an economical one,
too) of the times at which work is done, and does not therefore
mean a loss in income, but a steadying and regulation of
income.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, before the re-organisation which has been
consequent on Factory legislation, overtime and nightwork
were necessary in order to turn out a certain volume of trade
by a certain number of workpeople, and the influence of
restrictive legislation has been shown in the following
directions:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. An increase in the class of workers called "job hands";</p>

<p>2nd. An enlargements of the permanent staff;</p>

<p>3rd. A rearrangement of the employment of male and female
labour.</p>

<p>The third of these changes we have found to be practically
imperceptible, whilst the second has affected women most
beneficially.</p>


<h4>
<span>The job hand.
</span></h4>

<p>On the margin of casual and regular labour the job hand
stands&mdash;the reserve battalion of this section of the labour army.
She is generally a married woman, and commonly
the wife of a faulty husband. She does not want
regular work, and only desires to earn a certain limited
wage. When she goes to a factory in search of work, she has
to wait idle for hour upon hour, but she generally stays at
home until summoned by her forewoman. Certain kinds of
cheap seasonal work as, for instance, penny almanacs, are
almost exclusively done by her,<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> and she is commonly employed
either periodically, <i>e.g.</i>, for weekly papers and monthly magazines,
or casually, <i>e.g.</i>, prospectus work, for rushes. A notice
in certain public-houses, or information supplied to certain
known agents, brings her to the place where she is wanted.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_68" id="Footnote_68"></a><a href="#FNanchor_68"><span class="label">[68]</span></a> "The majority of the almanac makers are married women who stay at
home from February to July": Leeds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p></div>

<p>Job hands existed before 1867, but at that time they did not
hold quite the same position in the trade as they do now.
They were the <em>hands</em> who went to different firms for two or
three nights a month to help in a recognised rush of work
which occurred regularly. In the Commissioners' Report for
1876, mention is made several times of job hands who were
employed quite regularly for definite pieces of work at definite
times during the month. Firms publishing certain weekly
papers were in the habit of employing women in folding during
the early hours of the morning before distributing the papers to
the newsagents. Firms which printed monthly magazines needed
women to fold all night for two or three nights or more at the
end of each month. Such employment naturally came to an
end as soon as the Act of 1867 came into operation; but the
job hand only changed her hours. It became necessary
during rushes of work to call in extra hands, in order to
comply with the clauses of the Act, and many firms solved
the difficulty by employing job hands during the day instead
of at night, for a few days to meet the emergency.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> This
work was generally taken up by married women who had
served in the trade before marriage, and who were glad to get
a few days' employment from time to time.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_69" id="Footnote_69"></a><a href="#FNanchor_69"><span class="label">[69]</span></a> But this is not the invariable rule. A manager of a firm dealing largely
in magazines and periodical issues says: "The effect of legal restrictions
on our business is to make women work hard for two weeks and slacken off
for two weeks. There is no thought of giving the work to men, or of
sending it home, or of employing job hands."</p></div>


<h4>
<span>Increase of permanent staff.
</span></h4>

<p>The second method of solving the difficulty&mdash;by employing a
larger permanent staff&mdash;involves the erection of more extensive
premises, and can only be adopted by firms whose
financial position enables them to meet a considerable
outlay. It is probably the best means for ensuring
that work shall be done efficiently for the employer, and conducted
under the most favourable conditions for the employed.</p>



<h4>
<span>Nightwork and overtime.
</span></h4>


<p>But there still remains a slight residuum of nightwork
which has to be done by men. To this extent,
and to this extent only, can restriction be said to have hindered
the employment of women.</p>

<p>We have tried to ascertain how much this really means to
the women workers. Thirty-three firms stated that work of
the same character as that performed by women in the
daytime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
was sometimes given out to men at night. We cannot,
however, assume that the work is always given to men on
account of legal restrictions, and it does not follow that the
abolition of such restrictions would induce all masters to
introduce women for nightwork. Several of them, indeed,
emphatically deny that they would adopt this practice; and
in some instances we have been told that it was not observed
in the best firms before the law prohibited it, <i>e.g.</i>, "Mr. A.
remembers the time before the Act of 1867 (he has been in the
trade since 1851). He could have worked women at night, but
never would because of questions of morality."</p>

<p>These statements are, however, only part of the case, because
nightwork is generally overtime, and we must consider how
far employers care to practise it.</p>

<p>There seems to be an almost unanimous opinion against
overtime, and any mention of factory legislation appears to
suggest overtime at once to both employers and employed.
Experience has driven it home to them that overtime is a most
uneconomical method of work;<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> and as there does not appear
to be any demand for women's labour at night except occasionally
as overtime, the factory law in this respect is only
a protection to the employée engaged by the employer who is
still experimenting with this unproductive use of labour.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_70" id="Footnote_70"></a><a href="#FNanchor_70"><span class="label">[70]</span></a> "When the factory (now a large provincial lithographer's, almanac
maker's, etc.), was a small one, and it employed only a few hands, they used
to work a great deal of overtime. They used all the time they were allowed
by the Factory Acts and sometimes tried to get in more. But now they do
not find it pays to work overtime."
</p>
<p>
It is of some importance to note that a responsible spokesman for the
men engaged in London houses informed one of our investigators that
when men are put on at night to fold "they take it easy, and six men do in
two hours what two women do in two hours. They don't bother to walk up
and down gathering, but sit at it in a row, and hand sheets on from one to
the other."</p></div>


<h4>
<span>Testimony of employers.
</span></h4>


<p>Some employers, like Mr. Bell,<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> admit candidly enough that
legislation enables them to be more humane (and humanity in
this respect pays) than they could otherwise afford to
be. The Act is "a great relief," such an employer
has said. "Legislation is an excellent thing; existing hours are
quite long enough. If a person has not done her work by the
time they are up, she never will do it." "The Factory
 Acts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
are a very good thing," another has said. "Long hours
diminish the output"; or again: "Factory legislation is a
capital thing; I only wish it could be extended to men."
"Women are not so strong as men, and therefore the law
rightly steps in." "I think it would be very inadvisable to
employ women at night. I think legislation a very good thing.
Overtime is not really worth it." "Legislation is a very good
thing. I don't believe in long hours. Employers are often
shortsighted and think that workers are like machines&mdash;the
longer you work them the more they do, but this is not really
the case; if they work from 9 to 7 they have done as much as
they are good for." "The good done by the Factory Acts has
quite outweighed any evils or hardships." Another employer
remarked: "I shouldn't like my own daughter to do it, and I
don't see why other women should do so. I should think it a
very bad thing for women to go home in the early hours of the
morning." On hearing that restrictions were objected to on
the score that they hindered the employment of women, he
replied scathingly that it was rubbish, but that "ladies must
have something to talk about."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_71" id="Footnote_71"></a><a href="#FNanchor_71"><span class="label">[71]</span></a> <i>Cf.</i> p. 78.</p></div>

<p>From this it is evident that protection is viewed favourably
by many employers, on the specific ground that it prevents
systematic overtime. On the whole, they are of the opinion
that nightwork is harmful to women, and that after overtime
the next day's work suffers. Some are doubtful whether they
would employ women at night even if the law permitted it.
Nightwork, they assert, is unfit for women, not merely on
account of the harm to health, but because of the insult and
temptation to which they are exposed in going home. Whether
these views would have been held so generally before the
passing of the Factory Acts it is not possible to say; probably
the results have justified the Act, and experience has provided
moral reasons for legal limitations.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Such in the main is the attitude of employers towards legislation.
Of 103 who expressed an opinion, twenty-six stated that
legislation had not affected women's labour at all, sixty considered
it to have been beneficial, and seventeen looked on
all legislation as grandmotherly and ridiculous&mdash;one among
these thinking that legislation was all very well, and much
needed in the City, but that Southwark should be free
 from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
interference. The attitude of those employers who objected
to interference was expressed generally in some such way as
that it was "unnecessary" for their trade at least, even
if desirable for others. Pressed to explain what "unnecessary"
meant, they said that women could take care of themselves;
that protection was all very well for young girls, but
when women arrived at the age of forty or fifty they could do
what they liked; that it was hard on women that they should
not be allowed to work day and night as well; that women
could stand overtime just as well as men; and, finally, that
legislation pressed very severely on the employer, who had to
use the more expensive medium for doing nightwork, viz., men.</p>

<p>Such is the attitude of these employers, and it is fairly well
expressed in the following quotation from <cite>The Stationery Trades'
Journal</cite>, September, 1880:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We report in another column a case in which Messrs.
Pardon &amp; Co. were summoned for an offence under the Factory
Acts. Four women were employed during the night to fold a
periodical which is printed by Messrs. P. The youngest of the
four women was a married woman of thirty-five, whose husband
is unable to work, and she, like the rest, prized the job because
it afforded the means of earning a little extra money for the
support of her family. Under the pretence of protecting these
women, the law steps in and says: 'Your families may starve
or go to the workhouse, but you shall not work overtime or go
beyond the limits prescribed by the Act. You cannot be
trusted with the care of your own health. You may fast as
much as you like; it will do you good and help your children to
grow up stalwart men and women&mdash;but you shall not endanger
your health by working too many hours at a time.' This in
substance is what the law does for women. As regards the
employment of children and young persons, the Act is no doubt
beneficial, but surely women of thirty-five and forty do not
need the same legislative protection as children. A great deal
of sentimental nonsense is written and spoken by benevolent
busybodies without practical knowledge of the subjects with
which they meddle; and one of the results is the application of
the Factory Acts to women who are old enough to judge for
themselves. In the case alluded to there was more real
benevolence in providing work for women than in limiting their
hours of employment." As a contrast to these opinions,
 the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
views on overtime expressed in the Factory Inspector's Report
for 1899 are worth noting:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The prohibition of overtime for young persons imposed by
Section 14 of the Factory Act of 1895 has, in my opinion,
proved to be the most beneficial clause of that Act. It has,
moreover, been carried out without any serious interference
with trade and without causing much difficulty to the
inspectors.</p>

<p>"The further restriction in the same clause of the overtime
employment of women by reducing the number of times on
which it may be worked in any twelve months from forty-eight
to thirty was also a step in the right direction. If overtime
were abolished altogether except for preserving perishable
articles, the season trades would soon accommodate themselves
to doing without overtime in the same way that the cotton,
woollen, linen and silk manufacturing trades have done, for
they also are season trades."</p>


<h4>
<span>Opinion of employées.
</span></h4>


<p>Among the older workers in the trade are men and women
who remember conditions before the passing of the 1867 Act,
and the experience of some of them and the comparison
they make between work done before and
after the Act is worthy of note.</p>

<p>A. used to work till 10 every night when she first entered
the trade. She was glad when the Act was passed to get home
early, and never liked working late.</p>

<p>B. used to work from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. regularly, including
Saturdays. Frequently she had to work till 10 or 12 and
sometimes to begin at 5 a.m. The "young governor" used to
take her and some of the other girls home at night as they were
afraid to go alone. She disliked overtime, was tired out at the
end of a day's work, and thought the other women were too,
and she had often noticed how badly the work was done after
eight or nine hours at it. Later on, as a forewoman, she
noticed that the girls after overtime always loafed about the
next day and did not work well. Some women liked overtime,
but she noticed it was always those who spent the extra money
earned on drink. She did not think that work had gone from
the women in consequence of factory legislation, but thought that
married women were employed for a little while during a rush of
work where before the regular hands were kept working late.
She remembered how tiresome it was for the married women
 to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
get home in time to fetch their babies from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="fr">crêches</i> when the
hours were from 8 to 8.</p>

<p>C. has often heard her mother-in-law say that as a girl she
constantly worked all night and then had to work just the same
the next day. She used to consider that to get home at 7
on Saturday was early, and now every young lady looks forward
to her Saturday afternoon. Workpeople have a much better
time than they used to. There were no proper meal hours.
She used to get "just a snack between her work."</p>

<p>D. remembers that when they were busy they had to work
all night and all the day before and the next day too. They used
to work on Sundays and were given a glass of gin. She never
knew anyone who wanted to do nightwork, and thinks eight and
a half hours quite long enough for anyone to work, especially
when there is housework, too, when one gets home.</p>

<p>E. remembers the time when he was a boy and women were
kept at work all night; he remembers shops where they worked
regularly all night after working all day, for two or three times
a week.</p>

<p>F. a bookbinder, remembers women who worked all night
frequently. They were very poor, very rough, and of very low
moral standing. "Some of the women who worked could
hardly be said to belong to their sex." Respectable girls would
not come for such low wages, and also because they had to go
home alone through the streets. After the Factory Acts the
moral tone and respectability increased greatly; wages were no
lower and there were fewer hours of work.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_72" id="Footnote_72"></a><a href="#FNanchor_72"><span class="label">[72]</span></a> This is an interesting comment on the relation between low wages and
long hours on the one hand and character on the other.</p></div>

<p>G. says, "We used to have to come in at 6 in the morning
and work till 10 or 11 at night, and then be told to come
back again at 6 next day. I often used to faint; it took all
my strength away." She considers the Factory Act an
unmixed blessing.</p>

<p>H., before the Factory Act, has worked from 9 to 7, 8, 9, or
10. Often as a learner she stayed till 11 or 12, and once till
12 several nights running. Once she remembers being turned
out in a thunderstorm at midnight, and how frightened she
was. Occasionally she worked all night; they used to be given
coffee at 2 a.m. Once or twice she worked from 9 a.m.
 one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
day to 2 p.m. next day; "Excitement keeps you up." They
were allowed to sing at their work and be as merry as they
could; "We didn't count it much of a hardship." Some women
after leaving the factory would go and work all night in
printing houses; one woman would leave at tea-time and go to
spend the night at the "Athenæum" until 7 a.m. After the
Factory Act no one might stay beyond 10 without special
permission. Once she did work all night; they put out the
lights in the front and worked at the back. The only result of
the Factory Acts that she could see was that employers had
to have larger premises and employ more hands, instead of
working a small staff hard.</p>

<p>J. says "I entered the trade in 1863 when I was thirteen. Boys
and porters came at 6 a.m.; journeymen at 8 a.m. (sixty hours a
week); women at 8 or 9 a.m. All had to stay as long as they
were wanted, <i>i.e.</i>, till 10 or 11. Boys were frequently kept till
11 p.m. I was never kept all night. Conditions have improved
for both sexes, men's owing to Trade Unionism, women's to
factory laws."</p>


<h4>
<span>The opinions of forewomen.
</span></h4>

<p>The testimony of the forewomen is to the same effect. A. a
forewoman, used to work often till 10, 11, or 12 at night,
sometimes all night. Sometimes she was obliged
to keep her girls all night when there was work
that had to be finished, but usually she gave them a rest the
next day. She thinks it a very good thing that they should not be
allowed to work all night; the work is piecework and long hours
don't do any good, for they mean that you work less next day:
if you work all night, then you are so tired that you have to take
a day off; you have gained nothing. She used to find that so
herself.</p>

<p>B. a forewoman, thought the Factory Acts a very good
thing. Girls grumbled if they had to stop till 8, and she never
heard of any of them wanting to stay longer. "If you work
till 8 for many weeks you get used up; there is no change in
your life, and as soon as you get home you have to go to bed,
you are so tired."</p>

<p>C. is a forewoman. As a girl she used to work from 8.30 a.m.
to 9 or 10 at night every day from September to Christmas.
She had to stay till 2 a.m. one night and come again just the
same next day; she had to work from 3 a.m. one Good Friday
morning and sometimes had to come to work at 1 on
 Sunday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
mornings. This nightwork was only occasional, but she
thinks it a very good thing that it has been stopped; she never
found it pay; the girls were so tired the next day.</p>

<p>Another forewoman gave it as her deliberate opinion that
when overtime is worked the piece workers do not make more
as a rule, for they get so tired that if they stay late one night,
they work less the next day.</p>

<p>This is the unanimous view held by the forewomen, and it
comes with considerable force from them, as it is they who have
to arrange to get work done somehow within a certain time.
They are the people who have to put on the pressure, and are
in such a position as to see how any particular system of getting
work done answers.</p>


<h4>
<span>Exceptions.
</span></h4>

<p>Among the younger women&mdash;the girls who have had no
experience of conditions before 1867, the opinion about overtime
is not so unanimous. Some few like what little
overtime is allowed to them and say they would not
mind more. One such worker was met, just arrived home from
her factory late one Saturday afternoon. She had been
working overtime as a consequence of the Queen's death&mdash;the
envelope makers and black borderers were all working late just
then. It was a bleak and wet afternoon, and she came in in
high spirits, evidently regarding all life as a joke, and frankly
confessing that factory life especially was a joke, particularly
when they had overtime. "It is 'larks' working late, and
the governor he up and spoke to us so nice. He says,
'Girls, you won't mind doing a bit of overtime for the sake of
our dear Queen?' and we says 'No.' <em>I</em> shouldn't mind doing
overtime every day of the week. I like the factory and should
hate to be out of it." A few such girls there are who are in
excellent health, like the work and don't find it monotonous,
and, above all, enjoy the larger life that they meet in a factory
just as girls in another social scale enjoy public school or college
life. It is these who revel in their day's work and are not
tired at the end of it, but how in actual fact they would like
longer hours or systematic overtime it is impossible to say. It
is probably the rarity of it, the stimulus and excitement of
working against time for once in a way, the being put on their
mettle by the "governor" himself, that make the enjoyment.
We must also remember that the younger hands are those who
take the most anti-social views of work and care least
 about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
industrial conditions. But even by these few, when the idea of
all night work is suggested, it is scouted with horror. On the
whole, the view adopted is that when you have done
your day's work, you have done enough. A worker
in the stationers' trade assured us that overtime means a
doctor's bill, so you don't really make anything by it. The
experience of two women who had tried nightwork illegally
was also instructive.</p>


<h4>
<span>Overtime experience.
</span></h4>

<p>A. an apparently strong woman was once offered a night job
when she was hard up, and thought that it would be a "lark"
to take it. She went in about 8 a.m. on Friday and worked on
with intervals for meals till 3 p.m. on Saturday, being paid piece
rates for the day hours and 6<i>s.</i> for the work between 10 p.m. and
6 a.m. She was utterly done up in consequence of this work and
lost more money next week than she made by the whole job.</p>

<p>B. once worked all night in a City shop for 5<i>s.</i> and got no
good out of it, for she was so done up that she could not work
at all next day, and very little the day after.</p>

<p>Three girls working at the same factory, and speaking of
conditions there, said that when they were busy after 9.30 p.m.
men were put on to do the card mounting. These girls
ridiculed the idea that they disliked this or wanted to stay.
"You feel quite done for by 9 o'clock. Girls sometimes cry,
they get so tired in the evening." None of the three had ever
heard of any girls who objected to the Factory Acts. "The
little ones do not mind overtime so much because they get 3<i>d.</i>
an hour the same as the full hands, but the full hands do mind.
Overtime, <i>i.e.</i>, till 4 p.m., on Saturdays is not so bad because
you ain't so worn out."</p>

<p>C. thinks it a very good thing that women may not work at
night&mdash;"hours are quite long enough as it is&mdash;you feel quite
done up after working from 8 a.m. to 9.30 p.m."</p>

<p>D. is very much opposed to the idea of women working at
night; she hears that in some places they work till 9 p.m. and
thinks that dreadful. She has never heard anyone grumble
that they cannot work longer, and scoffed at the idea. She
herself hates overtime.</p>

<p>E.'s views are that if you've had work from 9 to 7 that is
quite as much as you can do properly. She never likes her
daughters to work overtime, because it only tires them out. It
is sometimes rather provoking when a job comes in late
after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
you've been sitting idle and you have to leave it, but thinks that
it is better on the whole. Some women wouldn't mind working
"all the hours that God gives," but it is very selfish of them.
Most can't stand it. If she had to be at the factory by 8 a.m.
instead of 9 a.m., she never did any more work, because she was
so tired.</p>

<p>So the instances could be multiplied. There is no mistaking
the note of relief that runs through the experiences of the
workers who have worked both before and after 1867. Forewomen,
employers and factory inspectors, who are in the
position of the "lookers-on at the game," from different
standpoints are nearly unanimous in agreeing that protective
legislation is beneficial.</p>

<p>The thirty-three firms, the authorities of which are returned
as having stated that they give men at night work done by
women during the day, consist for the most part of printing
houses, and the work done by women was folding. The
result produced by legislation is that men do the folding at
night and on Saturday afternoons, when there is a press of
business, but in one or two cases, a regular staff of night workers
is employed. As the men are slower workers than the women,
and charge a far higher price for their labour, it is to the
employer's interest to reduce nightwork to a minimum. Prospectuses,
however, and weekly newspapers have to be folded
during the night, and this must fall to the men's lot. In two
firms, men occasionally do relief stamping for Christmas cards
when there is a great press of work, and in one firm they do
card mounting. In none of the above firms is there any
question of employing men instead of women in the daytime.
In one of the remaining two&mdash;a printing house&mdash;the manager
said that perhaps he might have more women for folding; and
in another the employer distinctly said that he would employ
women for feeding his printing machines were it not for the
limitations on their hours, which renders it impossible to keep
them when a press of work comes in. These few cases can
scarcely claim to constitute a serious hindrance to women's
employment; nor, in view of the chorus of gratitude for factory
legislation, can they be regarded as a serious indictment against
that legislation.</p>


<h4>
<span>Has legislation affected wages?
</span></h4>

<p>On the question as to whether the restrictions of the
 Factory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
Acts have affected wages, it is almost impossible to obtain any
trustworthy information. In briefly touching on it,
we must be careful to distinguish between the rate
of wages and the sum total earned. There seems an
entire lack of evidence that the <em>rate</em> of wages has
been affected, although the sum total of women's earnings
collectively and individually is obviously lowered, when some
of their work is given to men. But even then the mere deprivation
of the chance of working unlimited overtime is an
altogether exaggerated measure of the loss in wages. A human
being differs from a machine, for, even when the work done is
mechanical, an interval of leisure and rest is essential, after a
certain point, before the output can be continued. Experience
has abundantly proved that for the regular worker overtime
does not pay, and is also a wasteful expedient from the point of
view of the employer.</p>

<p>The Factory Commission of 1866 published evidence that may
be accepted as reliable regarding the wages paid in the trade
before legislation intervened. Mention is made in the Report
of one firm of printers who employed four girls for folding and
stitching, three of whom, under thirteen years of age, earned
from 2<i>s.</i> to 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; the fourth, a sort of overlooker,
earned 12<i>s.</i> Another firm of printers paid the younger girls 4<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> a week;
the older ones 8<i>s.</i> and 10<i>s.</i> The women employed by a third
firm earned at least 14<i>s.</i> a week and 3<i>d.</i> an hour overtime. In
a fourth a young girl earned 9<i>s.</i> 10½<i>d.</i> for fifty-three hours,
another 12<i>s.</i> 10¾<i>d.</i> for forty-eight hours, another 13<i>s.</i> for fifty-seven
hours, and the journeywoman 17<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for sixty hours.</p>

<p>In a firm where women made envelopes, one girl working
from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. every day, and till 3 p.m. on Saturdays,
said she could earn 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and a journeywoman earned from
10<i>s.</i> to 12<i>s.</i> Women making envelopes for another firm earned
9<i>s.</i> or 10<i>s.</i> a week.</p>

<p>Paper-box makers earned, on an average, 9<i>s.</i> or 10<i>s.</i>, some
made 15<i>s.</i> or more. In another firm they earned 7<i>s.</i> or 8<i>s.</i> up
to 25<i>s.</i> on piecework. Timeworkers earned 12<i>s.</i> or 14<i>s.</i>; young
girls earned 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>These wages are very much the same as those paid to-day,
and the hours then were undoubtedly longer.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Nor must it be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> assumed that wages would have risen more satisfactorily had
there been no Factory Acts. Had there been any tendency
for wages to rise which the Factory Law was retarding, that
tendency would have shown itself in a marked way during the
intervals between each Act, but no such thing is observable, as
Mr. Wood's figures in the footnote indicate. Moreover, taken
all together, the evidence gathered by this investigation proves
that neither the demand for improvement nor the organisation
to make that demand effective exists in the case of the woman
worker. On the other hand, there is no evidence to show that
legislation has improved wages, except in so far as it has reduced
hours without apparently having lowered rates.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_73" id="Footnote_73"></a><a href="#FNanchor_73"><span class="label">[73]</span></a>  <i>Cf.</i> "The Course of Women's Wages during the Nineteenth Century,"
by Mr. G. H. Wood, printed as an Appendix to "A History of Factory
Legislation," by B. L. Hutchins and A. Harrison, where the following figures
are given as the estimated average weekly earnings of women and girls in
the printing trade: 1840, 6<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>; 1850, 6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; 1860, 7<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i>; 1866,7<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>;
1870, 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; 1883, 8<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>; 1886, 8<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>; 1891, 9<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>; 1895, 9<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>;
1900, 10<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i></p></div>

<p>On the whole there seems to be no ground for considering
that special legislation for women in this trade has materially
injured the value of their labour. There is nothing to show
that their wages have decreased, that legislation has acted as a
drag upon their income, or that they have lost employment to
any appreciable extent.</p>


<h4>
<span>Want of elasticity in the law.
</span></h4>

<p>A lack of elasticity in the law seems to be the greatest complaint
of the employers. On the face of it, it looks like a piece
of senseless red-tape that, because it is usually preferable
to an employer to open his factory between the
hours of 8 to 8, he may not when it is more
convenient to him, open it between 6 and 6 or 7.30 and 7.30.
It seems absurd that it was an illegal act of an employer to
allow two young women to begin work at 6 a.m. and work till
8 p.m., whereas it would have been quite legal if they had begun
work at 8 a.m. and worked till 10 p.m., due notice having been
given to the Home Office.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_74" id="Footnote_74"></a><a href="#FNanchor_74"><span class="label">[74]</span></a> <cite>Stationery Trades' Journal</cite>, 1898.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Henderson, as above quoted, gives it as his opinion that
"a wide limit of law is necessary for printing offices where
women may not work after 8 p.m. or before 6 a.m. Hours for
adult women other than at present should be allowed by the
Secretary of State, as for instance the folders of weeklies."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, it is felt that a greater freedom is needed with regard
to overtime. Mr. Vaughan, the Factory Inspector for North
London, in the Factories and Workshops Report for 1899 says:
"I find in some trades, <i>e.g.</i>, Christmas cards, great dissatisfaction
at the curtailment of overtime from five to three nights a
week, when the busy season lasts only for a month or so; the
allowance of thirty nights a year is not required, but an allowance
of more nights during these few weeks would be an
enormous assistance. The temptation in such cases to work
more nights a week than are allowed is universally great."</p>

<p>It appears to be a great hardship that women who have not
been working by day may not upon occasions work by night,
and both employers and employées are unanimous in demanding
that the law should recognise this distinction. There is a
great difference between retaining an ordinary worker through
the night, or for more than a certain number of hours per week,
and drafting in a fresh set of workers to do work by night at
stated periods in the month or at times of emergency.</p>

<p>Whether or not the law can be made sufficiently elastic to
allow of greater freedom with regard to period of employment,
overtime, and nightwork, raises difficult questions. No doubt
it would be an advantage both to employées and employers, if
the law could be made so elastic, but the difficulty of effective
inspection would be so great as to outweigh any possible
advantage. The early history of factory legislation and its
working shows clearly that the intention of the Act was defeated
because employers could so easily evade its clauses. At present
it is known to a factory inspector that a factory that opens at 6
always opens at 6 and closes at 6, unless notice has been
given that overtime is being worked; if, however, an employer
were free to open his factory at 6 or 7 or 8, as occasion
demanded, and close accordingly, the difficulty of administration
would obviously be greatly increased.</p>

<p>The same point arises with regard to nightworkers. It
is quite impossible to know among a staff of nightworkers,
who has been working all day and who are <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonâ fide</i> job hands.
Such cases as the following, which was the cause of a prosecution,
would occur far more frequently.</p>

<p>"Twenty-four girls who were employed at a neighbouring
printing and bookbinding firm, worked for twelve hours at that
firm on Friday, November 20th. They then went straight
 to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the Carlyle Press, and worked all night, going back to their
regular work at the other firm at 8 the next morning. The
forewoman employed by the latter firm said that she did not
know these girls had been working all day, or she would not
have admitted them."<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_75" id="Footnote_75"></a><a href="#FNanchor_75"><span class="label">[75]</span></a> <cite>Printers' Register</cite>, January 12th, 1892.</p></div>

<p>It must be remembered that so far as the class of job hands
is concerned, they owe their present position in a large
measure to factory legislation. By utilising them, the employer
has been able to meet a sudden press of work, and yet to comply
with the provisions of the law, so that, without the legislation
of which they now complain, many of them would not have
found employment. Moreover, job hands are not numerous
when compared with regular workers, and the provisions in the
Factory Acts which seem to bear hardly on casual labour have
rightly been passed in the interest of the permanent staff. To
accede to the demand for greater elasticity is to suppose a
higher code of morals on the part both of employers and of
employed than experience justifies, and it would also render
necessary a far more elaborate and irritating system of inspection
than at present exists. The efficiency of modern factory
industry depends very greatly upon automatic working&mdash;upon
its standardisation of conditions, and the existing factory law
with its inelastic provisions is, in reality, a great aid in
maintaining those conditions of efficiency. Now and again an
employer complains of some hard experience, and forgets that
a departure from rigid rule would destroy the certainty which
he feels that the law is treating him exactly as it is his
competitors. Such a feeling of security is essential to business
enterprise.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>WOMEN AND MACHINERY.</i>
</span></h2>

<p>There is a general opinion amongst the women workers themselves
that the introduction of machinery has ruined these trades
for them. But we have found that certain opinions prevail, not
because they have stood the test of investigation, but because
they are passed round, and have never been subjected to enquiry.
We have already referred to the question in a general way.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_76" id="Footnote_76"></a><a href="#FNanchor_76"><span class="label">[76]</span></a> P. 48.</p></div>


<h4>
<span>Effect of machinery.
</span></h4>

<p>The impression of workers that machinery is displacing
them, must be received with a great deal of reserve
as they rarely take long or broad views.</p>

<p>Mechanical aid is very imperfect in most of these trades, and in
book folding, envelope making, black bordering, etc., its use has
hitherto been greatly restricted owing to the nature of the work.</p>

<p>The census figures, moreover, seem to be pretty conclusive
that, taking the trade as a whole, machinery cannot have had
such a very destructive influence upon women's employment.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_77" id="Footnote_77"></a><a href="#FNanchor_77"><span class="label">[77]</span></a> An old-established publisher commits himself to the statement that
machinery has increased women's work by 20 per cent. The manager of a
leading Scottish paper and stationery firm stated, with reference to envelope
making: "The use of machinery is always extending; but only in the
direction of increasing the output; there has been no displacing of workers;
the result has been rather to increase their employment."</p></div>

<p>The following statement by a Trade Union official is at once
the most emphatic and most detailed of a considerable mass of
information on this subject:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Folding and stitching machines have largely superseded
female labour and men's labour too. <i>E.g.</i>, A. (a certain weekly
paper), if folded, etc., by hand, would employ thirty hands&mdash;now
it is all done by machinery. B. (another similar paper) by
hand would employ 100 girls and, say, twenty or thirty men&mdash;now
no girl touches it except just to insert 'things,' <i>e.g.</i>, advertisements,
and men merely pack it; machinery does the rest.
Even wrapping is done by machinery&mdash;one machine with
 one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
man does the work of eight men. At X. (a well-known London
firm) ten folding machines do the work of 100 girls."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the papers referred to have been created
by the cheap work of machines, and no labour has been
displaced by their employment. They have rather increased
the demand for labour. But the statement shows the efficiency
of machinery worked under the best conditions.</p>

<p>Another statement by a woman worker, typical of many
others, is as follows:&mdash;"Machinery is ruining the trade, and
workers are being turned off; thirty were turned off a few
months ago, and twenty more will have to go soon."</p>

<p>This applies to a certain well-known London firm of bookbinders,
and it is curiously corroborated by other investigators
who found in other firms traces of the women discharged from
this one. The firm's own statement, however, was that they
had to turn away "ten hands (young ones), the other day,
because of the introduction of folding machines"; but this
information was received five months before the woman
employed quoted above was seen.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_78" id="Footnote_78"></a><a href="#FNanchor_78"><span class="label">[78]</span></a> An Edinburgh firm states that one folding machine can be managed by
two girls and it does the work of eight women hand-folders. The firm does
not state if it turned away hands, but it considered that there is too great a
strain placed upon girls in watching this machine constantly, so their work
is varied.</p></div>


<h4>
<span>Displacement.
</span></h4>

<p>That there is some displacement, either directly or by the
substitution of younger workpeople, cannot be gainsaid
with reference to particular processes.</p>

<p>The class most affected is the sewers. The evidence in
support of their displacement places it beyond dispute, and
though the increased facility for sewing has created an extra
demand for folding, and some sewers have turned to folding in
consequence, this class as a whole has suffered by machinery.
Folders have been less affected.</p>

<p>The way in which the displacement is brought about is of
some interest. We have, to begin with, the general apparent
inability of women to manage machines, and we find that the
folding machine has tended to reintroduce men to aid in work
which for many years has been exclusively women's.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Here

 we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
have a case of men and machinery doing women's work. On
the other hand, the sewing machine does not appear to have
had that tendency, the only explanation apparently being that
convention determines that in these trades sewing machines
and women go together. Sewing machines are domestic implements
in men's eyes. It is very curious that it should be so,
but we are driven to that as the only possible explanation of well-observed
facts. In this instance machines alone displace women.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_79" id="Footnote_79"></a><a href="#FNanchor_79"><span class="label">[79]</span></a> The manager of a firm with an extensive business in popular periodical
literature says: "Folding, which was all hand work and women's work, is
now largely done by machines managed by men. Wrapping, of which the
same was true, is also largely done by machines which are managed by
men.... If the machine is large and complicated, men will replace
women, if it is small and simple, women will replace men."</p></div>

<p>No process&mdash;excepting the few rare instances in the typographical
trade&mdash;seems to have been opened up to women in
consequence of the introduction of machinery; and, on the
other hand, the instances where young persons, either boys or
girls, have been put to women's work owing to the introduction
of machinery are very rare. So all that has happened has been
that machines have somewhat changed the character of women's
work, and their chief effect, beyond the displacement of sewers,
has been to prevent the taking on of some learners who otherwise
might have been employed in certain branches of these
trades.</p>

<p>Conclusions can be arrived at with more accuracy in respect
of the paper-colouring and enamelling processes.</p>

<p>Paper colouring and enamelling hardly exists as a separate
trade now. Paper is coloured or enamelled, as a rule, in the
mill where it is made, and the processes are carried out by
machinery.</p>

<p>This trade, then, affords a definite instance of the replacement
of women's work by machinery, handwork being now a rare
survival. In one firm where forty-five women were formerly
employed twelve now work. The process of colouring by hand
is very simple. The sheet of paper to be coloured is placed in
front of the woman who wets it over with the required colour
by means of a long thin brush like a whitewash brush, which
she dips into a bowl. She then takes another round brush,
about 10 ins. in diameter, and brushes over the whole surface,
so that the colour shall lie quite evenly. The process
is now complete, and the sheet of paper is taken up and hung
on a line to dry. Enamelling is done in precisely the same
way, enamel, instead of colour, being applied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>These hand processes apparently survive in the case of small
quantities of paper which it is not worth while to colour or
enamel by machine. Those who have seen the process cannot
regret the abolition of hand labour. The work is rough and
dirty; the workers and the walls are all splashed over with the
colour, the result being picturesque, but not healthy. When dry
powder or dust is used in the process, meals may not be taken
on the premises. The work does not attract a high grade of
workers; they are of the job-hand type, friendly, rough and
ready, and by no means tidy or "genteel."</p>

<p>Paper colouring and enamelling was once a man's trade
but women replaced men for the same reason that machinery
has now replaced women, <i>i.e.</i>, cheapness.</p>

<p>Machine ruling has also been slightly affected. One of the
investigators reports of an Edinburgh factory: "In this factory
I was shown a ruling machine which was provided with an
automatic feeder, in the form of two indiarubber wheels, which
drew each sheet of paper into the machine with great exactness.
The machine, after ruling one side, turned the paper and ruled
the other without any adjustment by hand being necessary.
After being set, this machine required only the occasional
supervision of one man operative. It was estimated that its
output equalled that of twelve persons on the old machines,
whilst on some work of a simple kind which was merely to be
run through, it might replace the work of thirty."</p>


<h4>
<span>Cheap labour and mechanical appliances.
</span></h4>

<p>In these circumstances it is hardly to be expected that much
evidence could have been collected leading to very
definite conclusions regarding how far the cheapness
of women's labour retarded the introduction of
machinery, and the efficient organisation of these
industries.</p>

<p>With the large up-to-date employers, the fact that women's
labour is cheap counts for little in face of the fact that
machinery is rapid, and enables them on a small area and
with a productive capital charge, to turn out large volumes of
produce. "When we see a good machine," said one of these
employers, "we try it, and we do not think of the cheapness
or dearness of the labour it may displace." But with small
employers, and with those producing for a lower class or
special market, considerations of wages do enter greatly into
calculations of the utility of a new machine, and to some slight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
extent the cheapness of women's labour has retarded the application
of machinery in these trades. One investigator states
of a large West End stationer:&mdash;"Undoubtedly he would put
up steam folding and stamping machines if women's labour
were not so cheap." A printer who prints some of the best-known
weekly papers and reviews is reported to have said:&mdash;"Taking
it broadly, the cheapness of men's or women's work
undoubtedly tends to retard the introduction of machinery."</p>

<p>But the most striking proof of the connection between cheap
labour and handwork is given by one investigator who, whilst
being taken over certain large printing works was shown
women folding one of the illustrated weekly papers. Folding
machines were standing idle in the department, and she was
told that these were used by the men when folding had to
be done at times when the Factory Law prohibited women's
labour.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Another employer stated that he had introduced
folding machines as a consequence of the legal restrictions
placed upon women's labour, whilst another well-known
bookbinder said:&mdash;"If women would take a fair price for work
done it would not be necessary to employ machinery."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_80" id="Footnote_80"></a><a href="#FNanchor_80"><span class="label">[80]</span></a> <i>Cf.</i> pp 80, 81, etc.</p></div>

<p>A large printer of magazines reports: "The saving in cost,
and therefore the inducement to put in machinery, is much
less if higher wages are paid for men doing the work." The
scarcity of women's labour, we are told, induced a Manchester
printing firm to adopt folding machines; whilst, on the other
hand, the cheapness of women's labour has kept linotypes out
of Warrington composing rooms.</p>

<p>It is always difficult to trace out the home worker, and the
information we obtained was collected through communication
with School Board officers, Charity Organisation Society secretaries,
district nurses, sanitary inspectors, and workpeople. The
groups of trades investigated are mainly factory and workshop
trades, and are becoming more so. Home work is not so
prevalent in them as it used to be, and it is now somewhat
difficult to trace its effects in its present decayed importance.</p>


<h4>
<span>Home work drawbacks.
</span></h4>

<p>There used to be a good deal of home work in these trades,
but the growth of large firms and the introduction of
machinery<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> have discouraged it.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The material is
very heavy and sometimes costly, and has to be
 carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
handled. It is therefore difficult to move from workshop to
dwelling-place; and when handled in kitchens or other living
rooms it runs a great risk of being stained and spoiled. The
home workers find some of their own material, <i>e.g.</i>, paste and
brushes for bag making, and they save light and rent for
employers; but, on the other hand, they are apt "to send back
their work with the mark of teacups upon it," or spoiled in some
other way, and it is difficult to get them to return it punctually.
So in these trades, home work really does not pay.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_82" id="Footnote_82"></a><a href="#FNanchor_82"><span class="label">[82]</span></a> This seems to be specially the case in the provinces.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_83" id="Footnote_83"></a><a href="#FNanchor_83"><span class="label">[83]</span></a> One of the home workers (also workshop worker) visited said, "Home
work is given less and less and is difficult to get now. Only three work at
it&mdash;old hands&mdash;and they are going to stop it altogether, perhaps." Another
investigator reports of machine-ruling in Scotland: "Two elderly women
who worked a paper-ruling machine in their kitchen. They had been at the
work for thirty years, having been taught by their father, and have carried
on the business since his death. The father had a good business, and they
can make their living by it, but say the work has sadly fallen off. They get
enough orders to keep them going, and when very busy employ a girl
occasionally to help them. 'It is useless to try to compete with the new
machines they have nowadays. What used to be given to us at 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, can
now be turned out by the machines for 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> We couldn't afford to do it
at those rates.'" <i>Cf.</i> Appendix V.</p></div>

<p>The Trade Unions prohibit home work when they are able
to detect it. There is, generally, a healthy feeling opposed to
this method of employment, and firms deny practising it.</p>



<h4>
<span>Home work processes.
</span></h4>


<p>Home work is now mainly confined to book and paper
folding, sewing printed matter, black bordering and folding
envelopes, making paper bags, and designing and
painting Christmas cards which is done at home not
so much because employers encourage it, but because it is
undertaken by a class of women indisposed to enter a workshop.
The folding is mostly of cheap printed matter like
popular almanacs and other street literature. Also, a good
deal of folding thin paper Bibles and prayer books is done
at home.</p>

<p>Some paper staining is also done in living rooms by workpeople,
but the practice is less common than it was. "One
paper colourer, a married woman, whom we saw, told us that her
mother worked at the trade before her at home, and when she
herself was a baby her cradle was rocked on the colouring
board. 'Many was the night' that she sat up as a child helping
her mother to do the work. She certainly throve on it and
seemed immensely proud of her industrial career."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>


<h4>
<span>The home worker.
</span></h4>

<p>What home work is still done is given mainly to women
employed in the workshop during the day, and is therefore
illegal.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> In addition, women who have married
whilst working in certain firms, or widows of men
who have been workmen in these trades, keep up old connections
by occasional&mdash;if not systematic&mdash;home work. But as it
hardly pays the employer to avail himself regularly of domestic
workers, the work now done at home is chiefly given out to
meet a temporary pressure of demand, and would practically
disappear if these exceptional pressures did not take place.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_84" id="Footnote_84"></a><a href="#FNanchor_84"><span class="label">[84]</span></a> The wording of the section (31 (2)) of the Act, however, makes it difficult
to enforce.</p></div>


<h4>
<span>Paper-bag making.
</span></h4>

<p>The making of paper bags is, of this group of trades, most
extensively and systematically practised as a home industry. This
is particularly the case in the neighbourhood of busy
street markets, such as are found in South London.
The work is mostly done by married women of a rough class,
as a supplement to their husbands' wages.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Reporting upon
one such worker an investigator says: "Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; is one of
nine daughters, and seven are paper-bag makers. All her
cousins, aunts and relations-in-law have taken it up.... A
niece of hers was consumptive and could not earn her living,
but she was fond of dress. Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; taught her paper-bag
making and she soon earned 8<i>s.</i> or 9<i>s.</i> a week." The profit
which yielded this income is stated to be 6<i>d.</i> or 7<i>d.</i> per thousand
bags. Many women who occasionally work at paper-bag
making only do so to earn a particular sum of money of
which they are in need&mdash;say 10<i>s.</i> When that is earned they
cease work. Such is the casual nature of the employment and
the disorganised state of the labour employed in it.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_85" id="Footnote_85"></a><a href="#FNanchor_85"><span class="label">[85]</span></a> "In nearly all the cases that Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; (an employing bag maker in
the Borough) knows there are bad husbands. Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; is in the trade
herself to supplement her husband's earnings because she has nine children
and he cannot earn enough to keep them in comfort."</p></div>



<h4>
<span>The homes.
</span></h4>

<p>The practically unanimous report of the investigators is that
these home workers' home conditions are of the very worst.
"A very squalid and evil-smelling slum," "Very
poor and miserable house shared by others," are
typical descriptions of the dwellings to which the home work
investigations led us.</p>

<span><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></span>
<span class="smaller"><i>THE MARRIED AND THE UNMARRIED.</i>
</span></h2>



<p>The investigators tried to obtain information bearing upon the
interesting and important question of the influence of the married
and the unmarried woman worker on industry, on the home,
and on the family income. But the difficulty of following up
statements and testing their accuracy has been so great and
some of the factors in the problem so elusive under the conditions
of the trades investigated, that conclusions are stated
with considerable reserve.</p>

<p>The custom in the trades under review undoubtedly is that
married women should not work in them; and, as a rule,
only widowhood, or a bad or sickly husband, or a slack time,
brings a woman back to them after marriage.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Sometimes,
however, she comes back, because it is too dull at home.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
This is more generally the case in the provinces than in
London, where certain job departments, especially certain
kinds of folding, are filled by rather a rough class of women,
amongst whom the proportion of married is exceptionally high.
Throughout the reports sent in, it is most interesting to note
how strongly the sense of feminine respectability opposes their
fellow workwomen working after marriage, "unless they have
been unfortunate in their husbands."<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_86" id="Footnote_86"></a><a href="#FNanchor_86"><span class="label">[86]</span></a> For statistics see <a href="#APPENDIX_VII">Appendix VII</a>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_87" id="Footnote_87"></a><a href="#FNanchor_87"><span class="label">[87]</span></a> A woman worker says, "They come back after they have married,
because a girl who has been accustomed to make 18<i>s.</i> for herself is not
comfortable when she marries a man on £2 a week who is accustomed to
have that for himself, so she comes back to make extra money."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_88" id="Footnote_88"></a><a href="#FNanchor_88"><span class="label">[88]</span></a> So also it is interesting to note the lingering shadow of chivalry in this
connection. "Mr. &mdash;&mdash;," said one of the girls, "never will take married
women, but then he is always <em>such</em> a gentleman."</p></div>

<p>The average age of the women regularly employed is low,<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
because as a rule girls leave at marriage. The investigators
generally report that the age in workrooms appears to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> mainly between eighteen and twenty-three. The report that
"Four girls here out of thirty or forty are over eighteen" (Leeds
bookbinder's), is typical of many others. This fact alone has
an enormous influence on women's wages and makes it
necessary to be very careful in drawing conclusions under the
headings dealt with in this chapter.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_89" id="Footnote_89"></a><a href="#FNanchor_89"><span class="label">[89]</span></a> A manager of a provincial printing establishment estimated that twelve
years was the maximum workshop life of average girls.</p></div>


<h4>
<span>Wages and expenditure.
</span></h4>

<p>An attempt has been made to discover how far the earnings
of women workers in these trades are only supplementary to
family income, and how far the family worker is
entirely dependent upon them for her livelihood. On
the whole (but with important exceptions) they appear to be
supplementary. In cases, certain fixed weekly payments are
made for board and lodging to the relatives who are heads of
the households, but these payments are not enforced in times of
unemployment and are reduced when work is slack. Even
when being made in full they do not always represent the
actual cost of accommodation and living. It is becoming
less and less common, it seems, for the wives of idle and
improvident husbands to eke out their household income by
casual or seasonal work, but the practice is still followed and in
London prevails to a relatively considerable extent. In such
cases the women do not work for mere pocket-money, nor
again, do their wages cover the full cost of their living.</p>

<p>"Miss &mdash;&mdash; lives at home and her parents are evidently in
comfortable circumstances," runs one report of a book-folder.
"I went into the best parlour, where there was a piano&mdash;also a
high hat in the corner!"</p>

<p>The following gives a somewhat fuller picture of these
workers:&mdash;"Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; is a widow and has no children. She
looks about sixty and is probably about fifty. She lives on the
top floor in model dwellings (three rooms, for which she pays
5<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>) Her husband died in 1891 of consumption, and she
does not know what she would have done had she not been
made forewoman (in a book-folding room). She does not see how
a pieceworker can support herself. She must live at home. Most
of the girls working under her live at home and give their mothers
7<i>s.</i> a week, keeping the rest for themselves. She was doing some
washing and mangling when I called. A little girl comes to help
clean, but otherwise she does everything for herself."</p>

<p>A fairly large employer in London stated that his "girls are
living with their parents and work for pocket-money."
Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
"would think that about half lived at home." One woman
stated, "A bit of extra money comes in handy. It is nice for a
woman to put a little by&mdash;you cannot expect her to save out of
her husband's money"; another said: "A woman ought never
to let her husband know what she earns&mdash;if she is foolish
enough to do that, he at once becomes lazy and extravagant.
A woman should only work after marriage either to save a little
money, or to help a sick or delicate husband." A well-known
London general stationery dealer reports: "Some of the women
employed are the wives of the porters and packers, but in the
majority of cases the husbands are worthless, and the earnings
of the women are the chief support of the household." In one
case reported upon, a girl, working in a Bible and prayer-book
house, having to support herself, could not do it, and began
pilfering prayer-books to make both ends meet. She was turned
away as a thief.</p>

<p>For the purpose of throwing light upon the problems with
which this chapter deals, particulars have been obtained from
one firm in London where eighty-six women are employed.
The married women are described as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. A widow.</p>

<p>2. Has a husband, a bookbinder in good work, but they are
extravagant.</p>

<p>3. Has a husband in work.</p>

<p>4. A widow.</p>

<p>5. A widow with a daughter to support.</p>

<p>6. A widow.</p>

<p>7. Has a husband in work. Has been summoned for boys
not attending school.</p>

<p>8. Has a husband who drinks. Looks after her children and
goes home at dinner time.</p>

<p>9. A widow with recalcitrant boy.</p>

<p>10. Has a husband in work.</p>

<p>11. Has a husband irregularly employed. Very poor and
slatternly.</p>

<p>12. Has a husband who drinks.</p>

<p>Of the unmarried workers, one learned the trade when on in
years because, owing to a misfortune, she had to bring up her
brothers and sisters. She was very slow and her earnings only
averaged about 7<i>s.</i> per week. Two support themselves. The
others live at home and pay 6<i>s.</i> or 7<i>s.</i> per week, or hand
 over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
everything they make, and receive back small sums for pocketmoney.</p>

<p>A report from another well-known firm of bookbinders
in London states that in a room of ten women, five support
themselves. In some instances it is noted that married women
have to receive charitable aid in looking after their children
when they themselves go to work. Of a large printing firm it
is said, "Most of the girls at ... don't seem to mind if
they make money or not. They couldn't possibly keep themselves
on what they earned." This was the statement of a girl
working with the firm and erred in being too absolute; but an
examination of the wage returns showed that, somewhat
modified and limited, it was true. A manager of a co-operative
bookbinding establishment estimated that, from his experience,
not more than 25 per cent. of the girls working in that trade,
regarded their wages as the only means by which they supported
themselves. The forewoman of a large stationery department
stated that only three out of twenty girls under her had to
depend on their own wages. The conclusion of a report submitted
by an official of the Typographical Association in
Coventry may be taken as being true of the provinces generally.
"The females for the most part are young girls, with a sprinkling
of experienced and older hands who leave when about
entering married life."</p>

<p>Evidently it is a very common thing for such workers to
pay so much into a common purse from which general family
expenses are drawn, and into which the individual contributions
vary with the state of trade.</p>

<p>The industrial effect of these conditions is obvious. The
women keep no vigilant eye upon wages which are fixed rather
by use and wont than by competitive pressure. Employers
have rarely<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> to offer high pay as an inducement to women to
enter these trades, and, consequently, there is always a downward
drag upon wages, and although the women spasmodically
interest themselves in their conditions, they feel so little
dependence on wages that they can never be taught to make
that steady upward pressure which would improve the organisation
of these trades and yield more return for labour. Hence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> the low rate of wages obtainable by those who have to maintain
themselves is kept down almost solely by the circumstance that
such a large proportion of the women employed remain part of
families and share in general family income. It should be
noted that it is often the policy of employers to be "careful
only to take respectable young girls who live with their
parents." The economic influence of this "respectable"
standard is obvious.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_90" id="Footnote_90"></a><a href="#FNanchor_90"><span class="label">[90]</span></a> The establishment of a laundry in the vicinity of a well-known provincial
firm of printers resulted in an increase of wages in the shape of a guarantee
that no wages should be paid under 6<i>s.</i> per week.</p></div>



<h4>
<span>Influence on family income.
</span></h4>


<p>On the question whether an extensive prevalence of "supplementary
earnings" tends to reduce the wages paid to other
members of the family, our investigations in these
trades threw no light. Only in one case, where a
husband and wife were questioned, was the opinion
stated that, "Now that women go into trades so much, a man
and a woman together only make as much as a man used to."
The question is one which can be answered only by investigation
in other trades, the circumstances of which are more favourable
for its elucidation.</p>


<h4>
<span>Wages rates and married women.
</span></h4>


<p>What little influence the married woman has upon wages
seems to be to raise and not to lower them. That is
the unanimous opinion of the forewomen in London,
and they know best.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_91" id="Footnote_91"></a><a href="#FNanchor_91"><span class="label">[91]</span></a> The following are extracts from the opinions of forewomen on this
point:&mdash;&mdash;"They don't lower rates; they want more."&mdash;"They don't lower rates of pay; it is rather the reverse, for they are
most troublesome about the price; <i>e.g.</i>, the other day a married woman, a
new hand, made four or five girls refuse to do some sewing at the price
quoted, so they and she sat idle and wasted their time till the forewoman
saw what she could do for them. She (the forewoman) pointed out to the
girls how foolish it was to waste their time like that, and they said that they
wouldn't have done it by themselves."&mdash;"So far from working for less if they don't get enough, they say&mdash;'Thank
you' and walk off."&mdash;"They are the first to grumble; they don't think it worth coming unless
they can make something good."&mdash;"Married women are more trouble than the unmarried; they are at the
bottom of any agitation, and won't come if you are slack, for they wouldn't
get enough to pay for washing."&mdash;"They are more independent than single workers, and teach the others to
stand out."&mdash;"They think it a favour to do your work."&mdash;"They won't work for less, for they generally have more than themselves
to keep."&mdash;A forewoman of a book-folding department in a large firm said that
though not employing married women on her regular staff, she had had some
experience of them as job hands, and found that they would not do ordinary
work at ordinary rates, it not being worth their while. "They have not got
to earn money, as they have husbands to fall back upon."&mdash;To this should be added the testimony of one thoughtful observer, who
has considered the question during a long experience in the trade. He has
never come across a case where married women have lowered the rate of
pay; on the other hand, the elder women often complain that the young
girls who are living at home don't mind
having 1/4<i>d.</i> or 1/2<i>d.</i> cut off.&mdash;See also the Report on Home Work, published by the Women's Industrial
Council, 19, Buckingham Street, Strand, 6<i>d.</i>, for further details confirming
this view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p></div>

<p>In a good many instances, the married women complained
that the unmarried ones accepted reductions, and at a Conference
held at Manchester in connection with this investigation,
the opinion was unanimously expressed that married women
do not lower wages, but, "on the contrary, the casuals grumble
most and get most."<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> "I know of a case," writes a Plymouth
correspondent, "where a married woman would not work for less
than 15<i>s.</i>, which she obtained and retained for a year or two."
Out of a batch of ninety employers who had definite opinions
upon the influence of married women upon the standard of
wages, seventy-seven said they did not lower it, and thirteen
that they did. The married woman is more able than the
unmarried girl to appreciate the relation between wages and
living expenses, and when she returns to the workshop, it is as
a worker who accepts the life of the wage earner as a final fact
and not as a mere interval between school and marriage.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_92" id="Footnote_92"></a><a href="#FNanchor_92"><span class="label">[92]</span></a> The casually employed sometimes give trouble owing to unpunctuality,
and several employers have complained against married women on this
ground. But the investigation as a whole does not show the complaint to
be at all general.</p></div>

<p>The married woman is more independent and disinclined to
accept low rates when offered, and she is generally chosen to
go on deputations making complaints to employers. A Trade
Union official said that theoretically the married woman ought
to reduce wages, but that he was bound to say that his experience
in the trade taught him that she did not. She has acquired
the right to grumble, and she is put down in a considerable
proportion of the reports as the centre from which general
discontent in the workrooms emanates. Many employers
object to her in consequence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>She seems to regard herself as a permanent worker when she
is a widow, and generally remains for a considerable time&mdash;twenty
or thirty years&mdash;with her employers without thinking
of changing. She is not so "particular" as her unmarried
co-worker, and does not give herself so many "airs." She
cleans litho-rollers without "turning up her nose." She is, in
short, part and parcel of the fellowship of wage earners; her
unmarried sister is not.</p>

<p>She is more rarely found in the provinces than in London in
these trades. Leeds and Bradford, and Bristol and the surrounding
district may be taken as typical, and the reports of
the investigators who visited these towns are quoted in full
below on this point.</p>



<h4>
<span>The employment of married women.</span>
<span>(a) London.
</span></h4>

<p>In London, several firms refuse to employ married women as
regular hands. In some cases this is a policy of the forewoman
only, and not a rule of the firm. In others the head
of the firm is responsible for the order. The motives
vary. Some refuse on principle, holding that husbands
should support their wives; <i>e.g.</i>, "She won't
countenance husbands living on their wives' earnings and idling
themselves"; or, again, that it is "hard on single girls," or
undesirable to have married women working amongst unmarried
girls, because, "They spoil a shop by talking about all sorts of
things." Other employers refuse to have them because they are
too irregular&mdash;"You can't get them in in time"; others because
"one has no hold over them," or because "they are tiresome,
being so cocky." "Out of seventy-five girls," runs one of our
reports, "he had none married till recently, when he failed to
get enough unmarried. Dislikes having them because influence
bad."<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>As a rule, however, there is a certain number of married
women on the staff, and all houses who have recourse to job
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> hands in busy seasons must, on occasions, have married women
on their premises, though they may object to employ them as
regular workers.</p>

<p>The exact proportion of married to unmarried women in these
trades is impossible to judge. Accuracy could only be obtained
by taking a census of each shop. Estimates vary. A forewoman
of experience calculated that more than half were married. A
Trade Union secretary and an experienced worker estimated
that about half were married, whilst of the job hands taken
separately, more than three-fourths were married women.
Another Union official, however, reckoned that, taking the
trades as a whole, there were four unmarried to one married;
taking job hands separately, two were married to one unmarried.
Most of those conversant with the trade are careful to give
no figures, "a large proportion" are married, or a "good
few," and so on, are the common expressions. All, however,
agree that the largest proportion of married to unmarried
is found amongst the job hands; that, in fact, the majority
of that class of workers have husbands. A few instances of
the proportion amongst the regular staff in houses taken at
random are given below. In most cases, it was impossible
to obtain any figures, but the following may be taken to be
types:&mdash;</p>

<p>A. <em>Printing.</em>&mdash;12 married out of 86.</p>

<p>B. <em>Printing and Magazine Binding.</em>&mdash;Half the staff.</p>

<p>C. <em>Printing.</em>&mdash;2 regular hands unmarried, 1 married taken
on when busy.</p>

<p>D. <em>Envelopes, etc.</em>&mdash;5 girls, 2 married.</p>

<p>E. <em>Binding.</em>&mdash;3 married out of 20.</p>

<p>F. <em>Card Mounting, etc.</em>&mdash;2 married out of 30.</p>

<p>G. <em>Binding.</em>&mdash;3 married in machine room out of 60; 1 in
perforating department.</p>

<p>H. <em>Stationery.</em>&mdash;9 married out of 20.</p>

<p>J. <em>Printing.</em>&mdash;1 married out of 10.</p>

<p>K. <em>Binding.</em>&mdash;2 married out of 30.</p>

<p>L. <em>Printing and Magazine Work.</em>&mdash;5 married out of 100.</p>

<p>M. <em>Printing.</em>&mdash;1 or 2 out of 56.</p>

<p>N. <em>Printing.</em>&mdash;2 out of 128. (In most departments won't
take them.)</p>

<p>These houses show a much lower percentage of married
workers than anyone hazarded at a guess.</p>

<h4>
<span>(b) Bristol and district.
</span></h4>

<p>"Seventeen houses in Bristol, employing about 1,170 women,
have no married hands. In three of these, it is the rule that
girls must leave on marriage, because the employer
or the forewoman dislikes having married women,
either 'because they are not such good workers after they have
got the breakfast for their husbands and children, and seen to
the house, and are not then much good for work in a factory,'
or else because of a feeling that it is wrong to take married
women from home duties.</p>

<p>"In eight houses, employing about 1,200 women, there is no
rule against employing married women, and a few are employed.
The exact proportions were impossible to ascertain, but
mostly box-makers.</p>

<p>"So few married women are employed in these trades in
Bristol that it is impossible to find any evidence of their influence
on rates of pay, and the generalisations as to the quality of
married women's work are made on very little information. One
employer (B.) declared that married women are better workers
because they do not go out unless they have good-for-nothing
husbands and <em>have</em> to be the breadwinners, a remark corroborated
by G., who assigned the same reason for their superiority,
adding that married women make 2<i>s.</i> or 3<i>s.</i> a week more at
piecework than the unmarried, and seem more anxious to get
on. C. regards them as steadier than girls: "They take life
more seriously."</p>

<p>"In two houses in Gloucester with twenty-two and fifty-five
girls, there are no married women. 'They don't want to stay.'</p>

<p>"In Frome, a leading printing establishment employs 130
girls, but none are married. There is a rule against employing
married women. It is regarded as immoral to do so&mdash;'It
means that the husband spends the extra money in beer.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>"In Stroud, amongst thirty girls, none were married.</p>

<p>"In Bath, in a firm employing forty girls, a few were
married, but none whose husbands were in work. 'That would
be considered <em>infra dig</em>.'</p>



<h4>
<span>(c) Leeds and Bradford.
</span></h4>


<p>"Married women are rarely employed in these trades in
Leeds. Out of seventeen houses visited, only three had married
women as regular workers. One of these is an accountbook
maker's, where a few out of the thirty hands
are married; another is a wallpaper manufacturer's, where no
difference is made when girls marry, and the third is a paperbag
house, where a few out of the thirty women employed
are married. In the remaining fourteen houses, comprising
about 930 girls, no married women work. It is a custom
recognised by masters and workers alike that women leave
on marriage, so that the industrial career of these workers
stops usually at twenty-two or twenty-three. In two houses
old hands who have married are taken on for occasional rushes
of work.</p>

<p>"This dearth of married women in these trades seems strange
in a town where married women's work is such a common
feature in the mills, but is accounted for by the fact that the
girls employed in the printing trades belong to a comparatively
comfortable class, marry in their own class, and are not
expected to be breadwinners. One employer suggests that the
work requires more regularity than can be expected from a
married woman, but this does not seem to be a serious difficulty
in London.</p>

<p>"Bradford conditions are practically the same. Seven firms
have no married women, one has one married out of 100
workers, and this is an exception, married women not being
employed as a rule. As in Leeds, the hands who have married
come in to help when there is a rush of work. One manager
remarked that, if the girls think they are not going to marry
they leave for the mills, where pay is higher."</p>



<h4>
<span>The moral influence of the married worker.
</span></h4>

<p>There seems to be a pretty widespread objection to the moral
influence of married women in the workshop. "Mr. &mdash;&mdash;
objects to the employment of married women.
He dislikes the way they talk to the unmarried girls....
Lately he has been obliged to employ them as
he could not get enough unmarried women."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>


<h4>
<span>Family health.
</span></h4>

<p>As regards the effect of work in these trades on family life,
again the evidence is sparse, but so far as it is clear it tends to
show that the employment of women makes little
difference to the ordinary state of things. The work
is not unhealthy, and the woman worker does not do much of
the heavy tasks, such as lifting formes, using presses, and so on.
The instances where she does this are rare, and the men have
always, in this respect, turned their chivalrous instincts to
industrial purpose and to protect their own interests.
One investigator reports that a girl suffers from weak knees
on account of long spells of standing at a machine for making
envelopes, and that a vellum-folder complains of having to lift
heavy weights. Another reports against "powdering" in bookbinding;
and employment in typefoundries, where girls handle
type, is dangerous, since it may lead to lead-poisoning. Another
says that bronzing, even when the bronzing machine is used
and the precautions specified by the Factory Act are taken, is
unhealthy. A case is given of a woman permanently injured by
the excessive strain of working a guillotine cutting machine.</p>

<p>The bookbinders have always been ready to point out that
certain parts of their work are too heavy for women, and the
compositors have done the same. The latter also show that
consumption is a trade disease amongst them, and recently
have defended their attempts to exclude women from working
the linotype on the ground that the fumes and gases which are
generated by its typefounding arrangement are injurious to
health. They also maintain that standing for long periods
at a stretch is injurious to women, but in at least one
large printing firm in the provinces women were seen by
our investigators setting type whilst sitting on stools in front
of the case. The conditions of some wallpaper factories
seem to be unhealthy, partly owing to the hot air, the smell,
and some of the material used, especially the arsenic. Some
reports state that the constant "standing about" necessary in
these trades gives headaches and produces anæmia. What
valid objection there is against married women leaving their
homes and children for long periods at a time during the day,
must of course be added to this, in common with all other kinds
of continuous work in which married women engage, but there
is no special danger to life or health in these industries from
which the coming generation may suffer.</p>

<h2>
<span><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></span>
<span class="smaller"><i>WAGES.</i>
</span></h2>

<p>We have succeeded in getting the authentic records of wages
from about eighteen firms in London, representing every branch
of work in connection with printing, binding, and despatch, and
employing together 1,000 hands&mdash;more in busy, less in slack
weeks. We have also less detailed information about some
half-dozen other firms.</p>

<p>These studied together and apart will no doubt give a correct
general impression of the amount and variability of wages paid,
but circumstances have made it very difficult to group them so
as to give a simple bird's-eye view of the whole.</p>

<p>These circumstances are partly due to the very great
differences between the class of work done by the various firms,
and the difficulty of tabulating the workers under a few definite
heads; partly to the difficulty of collecting records. Our
investigators were recommended:&mdash;</p>

<p>i. To get complete wage sheets for as many weeks as their
time and the courtesy of the manager allowed, making the
record as complete as possible for 1899, and extending their
researches back as far as the books existed, choosing the wage
sheets of one week in every month.</p>

<p>ii. To trace individual workers through as long a period as
possible, choosing workers who would best illustrate all the
various conditions of employment.</p>

<p>iii. To note any other information.</p>

<p>As regards i., we have the wage sheets for some 470 separate
weeks, in addition to the complete lists of two very small firms
for one and four years respectively; ii., the complete earnings
of about 130 hands for periods varying from one to fourteen
years.</p>

<p>Owing to the fact that it was impossible to get the complete
lists through 1899 for many firms, and that the periods of
slackness and full work were not the same in different places,
it proved very difficult to handle the wage lists. At last the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
plan was adopted of getting complete lists of one busy week,
one typical week, and one slack week in 1899, leaving the
employers to choose the weeks, unless our investigators could
make a complete record. In the following analysis we have
endeavoured to bring out the salient features of the statistics of
each firm separately, and we have then grouped together all the
typical weeks, either chosen by the employer or selected by us
from the series; and it is believed that this grouping gives an
adequate idea of the wages at a time which the trade regards as
ordinary.</p>

<p>The earnings of the 130 individual hands is a very valuable
and, it may be, almost unique record. Many interesting facts
are brought out by their study, and the records should have a
place in sociological literature apart from their interest in the
present connection.</p>

<p>It has been necessary to make a technical use of averages in
collating and tabulating the material, and we offer the following
explanations. Where the word "average" is used without
qualification, it is the ordinary arithmetic average, obtained by
dividing the total by the number of payees. This is the best
for general quantitative measurements.</p>

<p>In most cases the median and quartiles and sometimes the
dispersions have been calculated. They may be explained as
follows. Suppose the wages of, say, sixty persons to be
arranged in ascending order, <i>e.g.</i>, 5<i>s.</i>, 5<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>, 6<i>s.</i>, 6<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> ...
11<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>, 12<i>s.</i>, 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, then the wage <em>halfway</em> up the list is the
<em>median</em> wage; thus, there are as many individuals above the
median as below it. The wages halfway from the ends to the
median (<i>i.e.</i>, fifteenth and forty-fifth from bottom), are the
<em>quartiles</em>, so that between the quartiles half the wages are
grouped. Thus, if the median and quartiles in the above list
were 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, there would be fifteen earning
less than 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, fifteen more than 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, thirty between
7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, thirty below and thirty above 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> For
a single measurement of the grouping of the wages about their
median, the distance between it and the quartiles is significant:
in this example 3<i>s.</i> and 2<i>s.</i> are these distances. The more
convenient way of stating this is to express half the distance
between the quartiles (2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>) as a fraction of their average 10<i>s.</i>,
which is generally very nearly the median. This fraction
(1/4 or ·25) we call the <em>dispersion</em>, and it enables us to study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
the changing character of a group in a very simple and efficient
manner.</p>


<h3>
<span>I.&mdash;STATISTICAL VIEW OF THE VARIOUS FIRMS.

<p><strong>FIRM A.</strong>&mdash;<em>Information obtained.</em>&mdash;Wages of thirty-six hands

<p>Total amount paid in wages and total number employed
each week, 1885-1899.</p>

<p>The whole wages sheet for one week in July and one week in
November for each of these fifteen years.</p>

<p>A. is a firm employing from fifty to one hundred and ten
women and girls as folders, stitchers and sewers. The
number employed has changed gradually; in 1885-7 there were
about a hundred: from 1888 to 1894 the number continually
diminished to sixty, and after a brief spurt in the autumn of 1894
to one hundred and fifteen and a rapid fall, has from 1895 to
1899 gradually risen from fifty to ninety.</p>

<p>Through the fifteen years which the statistics cover, 1885-1899,
the <em>annual</em> average (roughly calculated) has fluctuated
within the narrow limits of 8<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> and 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; it was above 10<i>s.</i>
in 1888, 1889, 1897, 1898, 1899; below 9<i>s.</i> in 1886 and 1894.
This average includes the learners. But when examined more
minutely it is seen that the fluctuations week by week and
month by month are very rapid. Briefly, there is a change of
about 4<i>s.</i> in four-weekly cycles. Thus in November, 1899, the
averages for the five weeks were 10<i>s.</i>, 11<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>, 13<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>,
13<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>, 12<i>s.</i></p>

<p>In November the wages are much higher than in July, and
evidently more regular in character; the number earning near
the average is also greater. Thus the "dispersion" in
November is generally about ·2 (the quartiles and median being,
for example, 12<i>s.</i>, 15<i>s.</i>, 18<i>s.</i>); while in July it is generally about
·4 (<i>e.g.</i>, 3<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>, 6<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>, 8<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>). Again, it seems quite doubtful
each year whether there will be any July wages worth the
name; the median in four weeks selected each year in July
changes from 2<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i> to 8<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>; while that for selected weeks
in November is from 10<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> to 17<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i>, a smaller proportionate
variation.</p>

<p>The majority are piece workers.</p>

<p>The following table shows the wages in two weeks (slack and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
busy) in 1899. The figures are probably typical of similar
weeks in previous years.</p>

<p>The wages of fifteen hands tabulated, most of them throughout
1897-99.</p>

<p>The work is divided into four departments:&mdash;</p>

<p>Binders, from twenty-nine to thirty-eight hands. The
median wage fluctuated in the three years between 11<i>s.</i> and 17<i>s.</i>,
excluding holiday weeks; 13<i>s.</i> is the general average. About
six are on time wages.</p>

<p>In the warehouse, where Government folding is done, five
hands are employed. The median wage of this group fluctuated
in 1897 between 16<i>s.</i> and 27<i>s.</i>, being low at the end of 1897.
In 1898 and 1899 it was a little steadier, averaging about 21<i>s.</i>
(piece rates).</p>

<p>In the envelope room, where folding and relief stamping is
done, seven to thirteen hands are employed. The median wage
is very variable, fluctuating from 9<i>s.</i> to 16<i>s.</i>, and averaging
about 12<i>s.</i>, chiefly time wages.</p>

<p>Machine ruling is done by from four to eleven girls. Their
median wage was nearly steady at 6<i>s.</i> in 1897 and 1898, and
rose regularly to 8<i>s.</i> in 1899. Nominally these were time wages.</p>

<p>The material is not sufficiently complete or homogeneous to
allow any complete account of wages at any date; but the
tables now given (supplemented occasionally by the raw
material) allow us to offer an estimate of the grouping in a
typical week of 1899, supposing each firm to be paying typical
wages in one and the same week. This method is rough, and
will not support any fine calculations to be based on it; but at
the same time it affords a view, sufficiently accurate for most
purposes, of the general trend and distribution of wages. All
classes of workers, except apprentices and learners, are included.</p>

<p>These figures are so similar in many respects to those which
generally arise when a large group of trades are massed
together, that they afford strong evidence that they make a
fair sample.</p>

<p>Remembering the roughness of the hypothesis, and not
assuming that these wages multiplied by fifty-two give annual
earnings, we find, in a week which the employers regard as
typical, the following: Average, 13<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; median, 13<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>;
quartiles, 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, 16<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>; dispersion .23. Thus, half the
wage earners obtain between 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and 16<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>; and 80
per cent. obtain from 7<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> to 20<i>s.</i></p>

<p>There is some doubt as to who are and who should properly
be included at both ends of the series. At the lower end, no
doubt, some learners have been included, and some piece
workers excluded, for in a typical week there would certainly
be some cases where the wages were abnormally low. On the
other hand, in the large number above 24<i>s.</i>, no doubt
many above the status of the ordinary worker are included,
and some are definitely stated to be forewomen.</p>

<p>If we omit all above 24<i>s.</i>, we have: Average, 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>; median,
13<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i>; quartiles, 10<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i>, 16<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The difference in these averages is not significant.</p>

<h3>
<span>III.&mdash;CHANGE OF WAGES BETWEEN 1885 AND 1900.
</span></h3>


<p>Where wages are continually fluctuating week by week and
month by month, while, in addition, there are depressions and
inflations affecting various groups of workers for one or two
years, it is a matter of very great statistical difficulty to determine
whether wages have on the whole been stationary, rising,
or falling. Even if we had a complete account year by year
these difficulties would remain; but as it is we are dependent
on the records of only seven firms&mdash;good, bad, or indifferent&mdash;since
1885, 1887, 1894, 1895, 1896, 1897, and 1898, respectively.
No amount of further research would make such records more
than very insufficient, for it is very rarely that the figures are
preserved for any length of time. What changes there are
may very likely be due to peculiarities of a particular firm, to its
success, or to changes in character of work, and only in case
of agreement in all the figures could we generalise. Our
conclusions, then, will be chiefly negative.</p>

<p>There is no sufficient evidence that wages in 1899 are above
or below wages about 1895, 1890 or 1885; the only difference
appears to be due to individual busy or slack years.</p>

<p>In the two cases (C. and G.) where machine rulers are
separated their wages have risen from 6<i>s.</i> to 8<i>s.</i> in 1897-99.</p>

<p>As regards the years 1896-99, there is no general agreement
as to any two years, but the figures are consistent with a slight
general improvement from 1895 to 1900.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the figures to show that the course of
wages in Firm A. given above is different from that in the
trade in general, while there is just a little evidence that it is
the same. We therefore repeat the annual average wage in
that firm:&mdash;</p>

<p>
1885.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1886.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1887.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1888.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1889.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1890.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1891-2.
9<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i>&nbsp; &nbsp; 8<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  9<i>s.</i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>&nbsp; &nbsp;  10<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i>&nbsp; &nbsp; 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>&nbsp; &nbsp; 9<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>

1892-3.&nbsp; &nbsp;  1894.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1895.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1896.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1897-8.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1899.

<h3>
<span>IV.&mdash;WAGES IN DIFFERENT OCCUPATIONS.
</span></h3>


<p>The occupations are so involved, and the arrangements differ
so much from firm to firm, that it is impracticable to state a
definite wage for any occupation, and the wages are so diverse
 that it is useless to speak of an average wage. The table on
p. 135 gives a general view of the wages of those hands who can
be labelled with some exactness, and it is seen that the facts are
so complex that they cannot be summarised in a few words. The
wages included are the actual weekly averages (total annual
receipts divided by fifty-two) in 1899, except where they are
otherwise distinguished.</p>

<h3>
<span>V.&mdash;EARNINGS OF INDIVIDUALS.
</span></h3>


<p>Out of the 130 lists we have, showing the actual earnings
week by week of individuals for periods of one to fifteen years,
thirty-nine have been selected, twenty-six of which are tabulated
on the following pages (<a href="#APPENDIX_VI">Appendix VI</a>.), and twelve of which are
represented in the following diagrams. These have been selected
as illustrating the various classes of workers and of work.</p>

<p>The most noticeable characteristic of the diagrams is the
frequency and violence of the fluctuations, and the same is
found in a study of the original figures throughout.</p>

<p>A few time hands (<a href="#APPENDIX_VI">Appendix VI</a>.; diagram C), are nearly
regular; only one shows perfectly regular earnings; many
fluctuate as rapidly as the piece workers (Appendix VI.;
diagram D. 2), and on the sheets we have several actual
records of lost time and overtime, showing how these changes
arise; others show a steady increase with slight movements
(Appendix VI.; diagram A. 4).</p>

<p>The four Bank Holiday seasons are marked on most of the
diagrams and wage lists.</p>

<p>The most interesting, novel, and important feature of these
lists is the light thrown on the very obscure relation (obscure in
all branches of industry) between "nominal," "average," or
"typical" wages and actual annual earnings; there are in
existence very few actual records of individuals' earnings over a
series of years for any workers in the United Kingdom. The
workers included in the list are among the more regular ones,
who succeed in keeping their place month after month. Though
the wages vary so greatly week by week, yet when we come to
take the average over any period greater than, say, two months,
we find there is but little variation. Thus, in the example from
Firm B. in diagram, the quarterly average is between 16<i>s.</i> and
17<i>s.</i> for nine years, except for absence in two quarters, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
the annual average is still more regular. The great bulk of the
regular workers (folders and the like) make a sum between £30
and £40 every year, and between £7 and £11 every quarter.</p>

<p>In view of this result, periodic pressure becomes relatively
unimportant for the regular hands. There is no season in the
industry as a whole shown in the wage lists. The different
firms and different workers have in many cases their regular
times of pressure like bank clerks and schoolmasters; these
times are sometimes monthly, sometimes quarterly. In other
cases no rule is to be discovered.</p>

<p>The most important effect of this irregular pressure is in the
number of jobbers employed.</p>



<h3>
<span>VI.&mdash;JOBBERS.
</span></h3>


<p>Jobbers usually come in at the busy season and make good
money. As they go from house to house, it is impossible to get
a full account of any particular jobber's earnings.</p>

<p>Jobbers are frequently employed in Firm B, and in many
cases the highest wage earned is by a jobber. Thus in the last
week of April, 1895, out of thirty workers, fifteen were jobbers;
the eleven highest sums were earned by them, five being
over £1.</p>



<h3>
<span>VII.&mdash;TIME AND PIECE RATES.
</span></h3>


<p>The distinction between time rates and piece rates is not
vital; the method of payment seems to be accidental, and the
custom varies from house to house. Machine rulers seem
generally to have time rates, and these are among the lowest
earners, while some of the best paid permanent hands are also
time. On looking through the lists of individuals' earnings, it
is seen that time earnings are sometimes quite as variable as
piece earnings, for hours worked fluctuate continually. In
other cases the time payment is much more regular, showing
fluctuations only at holidays.</p>

volume, except in the chapter on wages.</p></div>

<p>WORK.&mdash;Folding, sewing, numbering, etc.</p>

<p>REGULARITY.&mdash;The work is not seasonal, at any rate at A.</p>

<p>HEALTH.&mdash;Numbering is very bad for a weak chest and makes one's
head ache as well. Girls with weak chests cannot stand it. Folding,
however, is not unhealthy unless the hours are too long.</p>

<p>HOURS.&mdash;At B. they are 48 per week; but at A. they are 53½,
distributed as follows:&mdash;Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, 9 a.m.
to 6.30 p.m.; Thursday, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.; Friday, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.;
Saturday, 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.; one hour for dinner and half an hour for
tea being allowed each full working day.</p>

<p>GENERAL. The sanitary arrangements are very bad at A., and
lavatories open straight out of workrooms, and are in very bad
condition. One does not use them unless she wants to get a fever.
The company is very mixed. "You can tell that it is rather a low
place, because the girls wear curlers and nothing is said. When one
works at B. she has to take out curlers before she comes. You can
always tell the sort of place when the girls wear curlers."</p>


<h4>
<span>2. <em>A well-known Printing Firm in London. Forewoman's Information.</em>
</span></h4>

<p>WORK.&mdash;6 or 7 girls are employed at machine ruling, and a few
at vellum sewing and folding.</p>

<p>REGULARITY.&mdash;The girls are kept on all the year round.</p>

<p>HOURS.&mdash;The hours are from 8 a.m. to 7.30 p.m., with one hour
for dinner and half an hour for tea.</p>

<p>PROSPECTS.&mdash;Might rise to forewomen, but that not common.</p>

<p>GENERAL.&mdash;Work girls have nothing to complain of now; they
are always very well looked after.</p>



<h4>
<span>3. S., <em>Small Printing Firm in London. Employée's Evidence.</em>
</span></h4>


<p>WORK.&mdash;16 girls and 1 man (who is an engineer) are employed, S.
helping himself. Upstairs there are 2 men "blocking," and 2 girls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>powdering for them. The girls do all the printing, <i>e.g.</i>, the informant
can set up the type, lock it into the frame, make ready, and then
feed the platen machine&mdash;which alone is used in this firm. Informant
can also clean the machine. She also does "bronzing," <i>i.e.</i>, dusting-on
bronze with a pad. The girls powdering upstairs do nothing else.
A few younger girls fold circulars.</p>

<p>REGULARITY.&mdash;Work is steady, and they are always busy.</p>

<p>HEALTH.&mdash;Bronzing is most unhealthy. &mdash;&mdash;'s colour has all gone
since she was put on to it a few weeks ago. "You are supposed
to have milk to drink, but you never get more than half a cupful at
the end of the day, when it is too late. The inspector has been round
and has asked about the milk, but of course the manager said that
milk was always given." (Informant looked very ill.) She had to
stay away from work all the previous Thursday, and lost a shilling
in consequence. Her father and mother say she must leave the
work or she will die. "You see, they lost a brother of mine at
twenty-three and a sister at thirteen, and they don't want me to go
off too."</p>

<p>The powdering done by the girls in the blocking room is very
unhealthy. None of them can stand it long. They get ill and go
off elsewhere. It brings on consumption.</p>

<p>Feeding machines is very tiring.</p>

<p>One girl works the cutting machine, which is unfit for a woman
and very dangerous. A girl who worked it lost her finger and was
six weeks in hospital, but the firm paid her well not to tell. The
printing machines are dangerous, for you often get your fingers
caught; it comes back quicker than you expect.</p>

<p>HOURS.&mdash;The hours are from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., with one hour for
dinner and a quarter of an hour for tea; on Saturdays, from 8 a.m.
to 2 p.m., with half an hour for a meal. They never get away at 6
though, not till 6.30 or later, for there are the machines to be cleaned
and things to be cleared up.</p>

<p>GENERAL.&mdash;Mr. S. sometimes comes round and talks as if he were
the kindest of employers. "He'll say, 'Take care of your head, there,
dear.' It makes you sick to hear him. If he'd give better wages it
would be more to the point."</p>


<h4>
<span>4. Q., <em>Job Printing Firm in London. Visit to Works.</em>
</span></h4>


<p>WORK.&mdash;I went through the works and saw 10 extra young girls
sticking on pockets for stamps on to an appeal sheet of ...; one
girl feeding a platen machine which was gumming instead of printing;
4 or 5 upstairs in the regular folding room folding....</p>

<p>REGULARITY.&mdash;Q. has only 4 or 5 regular hands, and when there is
a rush of work, he takes on job hands. "You put up a bill and can
easily get 100 if you want them." He dislikes the custom, but does
not see how it is to be obviated in the printing trade. "You suddenly
have 75,000 circulars to do, and you don't know when the next
order will be."</p>

<p>HOURS.&mdash;The hours are from 8 a.m. to 6.30 p.m., with one hour for
dinner, ten minutes for lunch and ten minutes for tea. Girls prefer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
this to half an hour for tea and leaving at 7. On Saturdays the
hours are from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., no meal time being allowed. The
married women, however, rarely come till 9 a.m.</p>



<h4>
<span>5. L., <em>Printing, etc., Firm in London. Employée's Evidence.</em>
</span></h4>

<p>Work.&mdash;200 girls are employed at L.'s. Informant does folding
now, used to do sewing by machine.</p>

<p>REGULARITY.&mdash;The work is regular, "but you never know when
the work is coming in. They are always busy with the ... guides
at the end of the month, and two or three job hands come in."</p>

<p>HEALTH.&mdash;She has always found the occupation healthy.</p>

<p>PROSPECTS.&mdash;None; is slow herself. She has worked at L.'s six
years, and has never known of anyone becoming a forelady.</p>

<p>DANGERS.&mdash;She has never had an accident, and was working on a
machine for five years.</p>

<p>HOURS.&mdash;The hours are from 8.30 a.m. to 7 or 8 p.m., with an hour
for dinner (from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.), and half an hour for tea (4 p.m. to
4.30 p.m.) and from 8.30 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Saturdays. Sometimes
they are let off early if there is no work. But some girls go and
lark about in the street, and then the manager scolds the forelady
and she will not let the others go. She never takes a holiday except
Bank Holidays.</p>

<p>GENERAL.&mdash;Only talks to a few of the girls, but they are quite a
nice set.</p>



<h4>
<span>6. T., <em>Weekly Newspaper Firm in London. Visit to Works.</em>
</span></h4>


<p>WORK.&mdash;Folding, gathering, collating, sewing (all sewing by
machinery), or stabbing with wire, insetting, wrappering (glue pot),
feeding folding machines.</p>

<p>REGULARITY.&mdash;It is more or less regular, but there is the regular
weekly and monthly work, so there is less fluctuation than in
"binding houses."</p>

<p>Tuesday to Friday are busy days, and the forewoman employs
some married women who come in as long as they are wanted.</p>

<p>DANGERS.&mdash;One stitching machine is dangerous, the forewoman
said; the folded sheet has to be pushed along with the hand and
there is the <em>chance</em> of the hand being caught.</p>

<p>HOURS.&mdash;The hours are from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., occasionally till 8;
one hour being allowed for dinner and half an hour for tea.</p>

<p>PROSPECTS.&mdash;The girls may rise to forewomen and a sort of deputy-forewoman,
chosen by forewoman, to overlook certain rooms. The
girls are not, as a rule, at all eager for the responsibility.</p>



<h4>
<span>7. <em>Large Bookbinding Firm in London.</em>
</span>
</h4>

<h5>
<span>(A.) <em>Manager's Information.</em>
</span></h5>

<p>WORK.&mdash;Folding, sewing, collating, placing plates, laying-on
gold, etc.</p>

<p>REGULARITY.&mdash;The work is partly seasonal. They are busy in the
winter time, and work to limits allowed by the Factory Acts; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
are slack in the summer, and may even have no work for three
weeks or so at a time.</p>

<p>DANGERS.&mdash;They have only had two accidents. One was with
an ordinary sewing machine; the other was with a Bremner machine,
when a little girl was setting it up. She caught her finger in it, but
was not away from work a fortnight.</p>

<p>HOURS.&mdash;They work 48 hours per week, allowing one and a half
hours for meals per day, <i>i.e.</i>, from 8 a.m to 12, from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.,
and from 4.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.; on Saturdays, from 8 a.m to 12.
This really comes to 49 hours a week if the girls are punctual, but
he reckons 48 hours because they are not punctual.</p>

<p>PROSPECTS.&mdash;Only a chance of rising to forewomen.</p>




<h5>
<span>(B.) <em>Forewoman's Evidence.</em>
</span></h5>

<p>REGULARITY.&mdash;It is a season trade and they are just beginning to
be slack (March) in Miss X.'s shop where the new work is done.</p>

<p>HEALTH.&mdash;Miss X. "had been through it all," and thought folding
dreadfully tiring. There is nothing specially unhealthy about it.</p>

<p>HOURS.&mdash;The hours are supposed to be 49 a week, but if there is
any work they do not keep to that. A 48 hours' week only means
that the time workers get paid extra. Miss X. worked in a place
where they were supposed to have 51 hours a week but rarely made
more than 40.</p>

<p>The firm make their girls stay as little as possible when there is
no work, but this is very different to most places, as the workpeople
are studied here.</p>



<h5>
<span>(C.) <em>Employée's Evidence.</em>
</span></h5>


<p>WORK.&mdash;In E., Bible work and new or cloth work are quite
separate, and there are separate hands for each. She did folding for
the Bible work herself.</p>

<p>HEALTH.&mdash;The work is not very healthy. "Sitting all day is bad
for you," but there is no special disease. Bible work is light work,
as much of it is on India paper; new work is much heavier.</p>

<p>HOURS.&mdash;The hours are from 8.30 a.m. to 6.30 p.m., with an hour
for dinner and half an hour for tea, but when busy they work till 8 p.m.
or 9 p.m. This happens about thirty times a year. They are allowed
to go home if there is not work.</p>

<p>[There is a very nice set of girls at the Bible work; they are
particular there about whom they take, and it is a very good house
to be in.]</p>

<p>GENERAL.&mdash;It is rather dull and tiring working because they are
not supposed to talk to each other at Bible work.</p>



<h4>
<span>8. <em>Printing and Stationery Firm in London. General Information.</em>
</span>
</h4>


<p>TRAINING.&mdash;In the BOOK-FOLDING
 and VELLUM SEWING DEPARTMENT
the girls have an agreement to serve two years.</p>

<p><em>Age at beginning.</em>&mdash;Fourteen.</p>

<p><em>Premium.</em>&mdash;None.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Wages.</em>&mdash;6 months at 1<i>s.</i>, 6 months at 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, 6 months at 5<i>s.</i>, and
6 months at 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per week.</p>

<p>In the NUMBERING, RELIEF STAMPING, etc., PACKING DEPARTMENT
there are no indentures or regular system of apprenticeship but
girls are expected to serve about two years.</p>

<p><em>Age at beginning.</em>&mdash;Fourteen.</p>

<p><em>Premium.</em>&mdash;None.</p>

<p><em>Wages.</em>&mdash;Girls start at 1<i>s.</i> per week, for, say, three months, then get
three-quarter earnings. Very few are trained in this firm, they take
on workers who have learnt elsewhere. How many branches learners
are taught seems to depend on chance. Some old hands do all the
processes, some only one.</p>

<p>MACHINE RULING.&mdash;In this department there is no system. Little
girls come and feed at 5<i>s.</i> and 7<i>s.</i> per week. When they have been
at it a year or two they are drafted off to other departments.</p>

<p>LITHOGRAPHIC WORK.&mdash;There is no regular training in this
department. It only takes about two weeks to learn the work
done by girls here.</p>

<p>NOTEPAPER FOLDING requires no training. "Why! you could
pick it up in a week or two."</p>

<p>WAGES.&mdash;The firm does much work for public bodies, and so has
to pay "fair" wages. The manager did not seem to know whether
this applied to women's work too, but evidently it does.</p>

<p>DEPARTMENT I.&mdash;NUMBERING, etc.&mdash;The manager gave wages
as 11<i>s.</i> to 16<i>s.</i> per week, some being paid on time and some on piece
work. The foreman considered 14<i>s.</i> to be about the average. The
following girls were questioned:&mdash;</p>

<p>One packer got 12<i>s.</i> (time wages) per week.</p>

<p>Another packer got 13<i>s.</i> (time wages) per week.</p>

<p>One piece relief stamper got about 13<i>s.</i> (piece work) per week.</p>

<p>Another piece relief stamper got about 16<i>s.</i> (piece work) per
week.</p>

<p>One numberer got 15<i>s.</i> (piece work) per week.</p>

<p>DEPARTMENT II.&mdash;LITHOGRAPHIC FEEDING.&mdash;Here girls start at
6<i>s.</i> and rise up to 14<i>s.</i> (time wages).</p>

<p>DEPARTMENT III.&mdash;MACHINE RULING.&mdash;In this department all
wages are for time work. Quite little girls receive 4<i>s.</i> or 5<i>s.</i> up
to 7<i>s.</i> per week. They are drafted off when they want higher
wages than that. There were, however, two older ones in the room
who were folding and counting the ruled foolscap paper at 14<i>s.</i> per
week.</p>

<p>DEPARTMENT IV.&mdash;BOOK-FOLDING, etc.&mdash;Out of the 45 girls
employed in this department, 10 were on time work, and were being
paid from 13<i>s.</i> to 16<i>s.</i> per week. The piece workers, according to
the forewoman, were making from 13<i>s.</i> to 16<i>s.</i> per week, taking all
the year round. Some were making over 20<i>s.</i> per week.</p>

<p>DEPARTMENT V.&mdash;VELLUM WORK.&mdash;All 15 girls employed here
were on time work. They got 11<i>s.</i> per week when first out of their
time; 12<i>s.</i> after two years. None were receiving over 12<i>s.</i>, except one
who "makes up" at 13<i>s.</i> a week. These wages were given by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
forewoman. The manager seemed surprised that they were not
higher, and remarked that they were lower than in the book-folding
department. The forewoman said that in most places the vellum
workers got more than book workers, but this firm had arranged
otherwise.</p>

<p>DEPARTMENT VI.&mdash;The girls FOLDING NOTEPAPER in the warehouse
were getting 13<i>s.</i> or 14<i>s.</i> (time wages) per week.</p>

<p>WORK.&mdash;Department I.&mdash;NUMBERING, RELIEF STAMPING, PERFORATING,
PACKING, and GUMMING going on.</p>

<p>The numbering and the stamping are different trades, done by
different girls, but most of them can do packing as well, though in
some cases they learn packing only. They can mostly do perforating
and gumming, odds and ends too. Some were folding postal forms.
Special envelope orders are done here. About 35 girls were
employed.</p>

<p>There was one man doing the illuminating required and working
at a rather heavy press. There was also a good number of youths
doing numbering. I tried vainly to find out what they were paid.
The manager and the foreman said that they were not doing the
same work; it was the same except that a name was stamped on as
well as a number (it was on money orders). Two girls were also
doing this, but I was assured that that was only "by accident." Two
or three boys were perforating and stamping.</p>

<p>DEPARTMENT II.&mdash;LITHO PRINTING. Girls were feeding machines
and washing rollers. About 12 girls were employed.</p>

<p>DEPARTMENT III.&mdash;MACHINE RULING. Little girls were feeding
the ruling machines, and a few older ones were counting and folding
the foolscap paper; 18 girls were employed.</p>

<p>DEPARTMENT IV.&mdash;BOOKBINDING and SEWING. All sorts of
folding, sewing and stitching (by machine mostly), eyeletting, etc., etc.,
were being carried on, and about 45 girls were employed.</p>

<p>DEPARTMENT V.&mdash;VELLUM WORK. SEWING, FOLDING, etc., for
account books and ledgers was being done; 15 girls were employed,
also one girl "laying-on" for cloth work, and two or three running
errands.</p>

<p>DEPARTMENT VI.&mdash;In the WAREHOUSE were three girls folding
notepaper.</p>

<p>REGULARITY.&mdash;Work here is constant all the year round. The
forewoman in the book-folding department said they only had in job
hands about twice a year.</p>

<p>HOURS.&mdash;The firm works about 54 hours per week, <i>i.e.</i>, from 8 a.m.
to 7 p.m., with one hour for dinner, half an hour for tea, and ten
minutes for lunch. On Saturdays they work from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m.</p>

<p>OVERTIME.&mdash;It was very difficult to get anything definite about
overtime pay. The manager first said that they all got 6<i>d.</i> an hour
overtime. Then he said that piece workers were simply paid at
piece rates. The forewoman in the book-folding department said
that time hands got 4<i>d.</i> an hour overtime. In the vellum work they
never had any overtime. These extra payments seem to be irregularly
made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>PROSPECTS.&mdash;The girls can rise to forewoman's position, here or
elsewhere. Vellum work forewoman mentioned that two of her
young ladies had become forewomen elsewhere.</p>

<p>ORGANISATION.&mdash;The manager knew that a Women's Union
existed, but thought it was more of a Benefit Society than anything
else. He assured me that the problem of the organisation
of women's labour was the problem in trade, and seemed vaguely to
regret that women were so helpless and ready to be cut down.</p>

<p>MARRIED AND UNMARRIED.&mdash;The manager estimated twelve years
as the average period that a woman remained in the trade. He
fancied that there were a good many married women here; but when
we went round and asked the different heads of departments we found
that the only married ones were 2 in the litho department, <i>i.e.</i>, 2 out
of 12 in that department, <i>i.e.</i>, 2 out of about 128 employed altogether.
In the other departments the forewomen or foremen did not care to
have them because they were so irregular. "You can never count
on them." Two widows were employed in the book-folding department.
The head of the litho department had only lately found out
that two of his employees were married&mdash;one had run away from her
husband, the other's husband was a stone polisher and she had to
come out to keep the house going. The manager was very decided
that undoubtedly married women's work tended to lower wages.
They only want a little to supplement their husbands' earnings.
He explained afterwards that his remarks applied more to the
provinces than to London. He thought that the thing to aim at in
improving the industrial position of women was the abolition of the
married woman worker. How this could be done he could not say.
The forewoman of the book-folding and sewing department, who had
had some experience of married jobbers, said that they would not do
ordinary work at ordinary rates, as they did not consider it worth
their while. They had not <em>got</em> to earn any money, as they had
husbands to fall back upon. The manager said that in the litho
department the single girls thought it <em>infra dig.</em> to wash the rollers,
but the married women "made no bones about it."</p>

<p>LEGISLATION.&mdash;In no case had women been turned away because
of restrictive legislation. A certain amount of folding and stitching
has to be done by men at night, and he would say that about 2 or
3 men were employed at this for about one hour five nights in the
week. Sometimes the folding was not ready till 11 p.m., and the
men had to hang about before. The manager thought that the chief
grievance of the Factory Acts was that if only one woman in a
department was employed overtime, one of the thirty legal nights was
thereby used up. The manager thought that it was forty-eight nights
you might work overtime, and seemed surprised on looking up the
notices to find that it was thirty only. He approved of Factory
Legislation on the whole, and thought that women had benefited by
it. Personally, he would like to see all overtime abolished by law
for men and women. Men worked worse next day when they had
had to sit up at night. Public bodies were the worst offenders in
the matter, "They have no consciences." The forewoman of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
folding and sewing, where overtime was worked, said that her girls
disliked overtime very much; and she did not think it worth while
working them, as they could do less work next day in consequence.
She had much rather that the men did it at night. She and the
manager agreed that in places where women did not make a decent
wage by working ordinary hours they might want to work at night.
As to the effect Factory Legislation had upon the diverting of work
from the home to the workshop, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versâ</i>, the manager thought
that the tendency had been for work to come in to the factory.
There used to be much more home work.</p>

<p>MEN AND WOMEN.&mdash;According to the manager, there is a hard
and fast line drawn by the various Societies in London as to what a
woman may or may not do.</p>

<p>In <em>Bookbinding</em> of all descriptions she is practically confined to
folding and sewing. She may not touch a glue brush or do any
putting of paper books or magazines into paper covers.</p>

<p>In the provinces, on the other hand, the rules of the Consolidated
Societies are different. A woman may do flush binding (<i>i.e.</i>, books
whose covers are cut on a level with the leaves and which have no
"turnings in") up and foolscap size, two quires. Hence women do
diaries, etc. In certain works at Tonbridge women are set to do
this.</p>

<p><em>Litter-press Printing.</em>&mdash;This firm had never tried female compositors.
They had 100 men. If they tried to introduce women, all the men
would go out and "you'd have a hornet's nest." The idea of
paying women at the same rate as men struck them as ridiculous.
"They would never be worth as much because they stay such a
little time." They might some day try women compositors in their
country establishment.</p>

<p><em>Feeding Printing Machines.</em>&mdash;They might not employ women on
platen machines because of the Union, but were going to try them
on smallish letter-press machines. The Union had no objection
to that.</p>

<p><em>Machine Ruling.</em>&mdash;The firm only had little girls for feeding. The
foreman remarked that at R.'s, "over the water," they had women
to do most of their ruling, but did not seem to think that it would be
worth while to train a woman for it. At first he said that the Men's
Union would object, then said that he thought they would not;
only he would have to give the woman the same pay as a man,
"and fancy giving a woman 32<i>s.</i> a week!" This was uttered in a
tone of supreme contempt. The manager remarked that he supposed
it would not matter paying the woman the same if she did as much
work, but the foreman smiled superior to the idea.</p>

<p>WOMEN AND MACHINERY.&mdash;The manager thought that the output
of printed matter had increased so enormously since the introduction
of machinery that more hands than ever were employed.</p>

<p>The forewoman of the folding and sewing department said that it
seemed as if there must be fewer employed, and yet she had never
turned any off.</p>

<p>HOME WORK.&mdash;No home work is given out by the firm. Since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
so much was done by machinery it was not worth while to send
work out.</p>

<p>INFLUENCE ON FAMILY INCOME.&mdash;The manager and forewoman and
foreman said that none of the girls were working for pocket-money.
Most lived at home and helped their parents; some who had no
parents lived with relatives.</p>

<p>GENERAL.&mdash;The premises were rather nice and the people looked
superior and friendly. There was a great gulf fixed between the
litho girls and the others. The latter look down tremendously on
these former and would not think of speaking to them. They are a
much lower set to look at and their language is reported not to be
choice. Many of them were arrayed in curlers, whilst none of the
girls in other departments wore these decorations.</p>

<p>The vellum sewers were said by their forewoman to be "a nice
family party."</p>



<h4>
<span>9.  <em>Lithographic Firm. General Information.</em></span>
</h4>


<p>GENERAL.&mdash;I saw the manager; he was "very much on the spot,"
friendly and communicative, and took me all over the works and was
quite interested in showing different processes. He said he had to
look sharp after his workers, and so they often thought him a
bully.</p>

<p>WORK.&mdash;Chief work done is lithography, but there is also a certain
amount of letter-press work. Engraving and stationery orders are
given out in sub-contract.</p>

<p>TRAINING.&mdash;In the binding room, <i>i.e.</i>, where folding is done, there
are no learners now, but they need to have one or two. These
apprentices were taken on from fourteen years of age without
premiums, and were kept two or three years according to ability.
They were paid a few shillings to begin with, and, if good at their
work, they rose gradually. If slow and stupid, they got nothing.
The forewoman said she did not care to take learners now; "they
are more trouble than they are worth."</p>

<p>In the litho room the firm never had apprentices. The new hands
come in and begin "taking-off" for about 8<i>s.</i> By-and-by, according
to their nimbleness, they are elevated to "layers-on."</p>

<p>In card mounting there is no training. It is picked up in a few
months, and new hands start at about 8<i>s.</i> per week, time wages.</p>

<p>WAGES.&mdash;<em>Binding Room.</em>&mdash;The staff (12 girls) are all on time work,
the extra hands are paid piece work. Time wages range from 12<i>s.</i>
to 14<i>s.</i> I was shown last week's wages, and they ranged from 7<i>s.</i> to
15<i>s.</i>, the forewoman having £1 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; 7<i>s.</i> to 8<i>s.</i> was the predominant
figure. Job hands on piece "make as much as 15<i>s.</i> in a full week,"
I was informed, but the wage book that week showed they had only
made about 7<i>s.</i> or 8<i>s.</i></p>

<p>For overtime, time and a quarter is paid to all time workers,
ordinary rates to piece workers.</p>

<p><em>Litho Work.</em>&mdash;All wages in this department are time wages, and
vary from 8<i>s.</i> to 12<i>s.</i> or 14<i>s.</i> In the wages book the predominant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
figure was 7<i>s.</i>; there were two 5<i>s.</i> and some 8<i>s.</i>, and up to 12<i>s.</i>
When bronzing the workers appeared to get 1<i>s.</i> extra.</p>

<p><em>Card Mounting.</em>&mdash;All time wages paid here, and they were said to
range from 8<i>s.</i> to 12<i>s.</i> In the wages book, however, 6<i>s.</i> and 7<i>s.</i> were
the predominant figures. Some were as low as 5<i>s.</i>, and there were
a few girls who had drawn 8<i>s.</i></p>

<p>NO. EMPLOYED.&mdash;There were about 200 employees, of whom one-third
were women. The number fluctuated, I was told.</p>

<p><em>Litho Artists' Work.</em>&mdash;8 or 9 men were employed on this, but
no women on the premises. The firm often accepted sketches
from lady artists living outside, some of whom could even work on
stone.</p>

<p><em>Litho Machine Work.</em>&mdash;Girls are employed feeding litho machines,
and they have about 30 when busy. When I was there only about
12 were engaged. When bronzing by hand is wanted these girls
are set to it (13 were doing it last week). In the same room is</p>

<p><em>Card Mounting.</em>&mdash;There were only 3 girls at that, but sometimes
there are as many as 12 or 13. This consists of pasting the advertisement,
almanac, etc., on to a piece of cardboard, varnishing it, eyeletting
it, tying the bits of cord through (the 3 girls were doing that), and
sometimes putting gelatine over the surface&mdash;a minor trade, at
which they get better paid.</p>

<p>The same girls do occasional work in the <em>cutting</em> room; not at the
big guillotines, but (<em>a</em>) at feeding a machine which cuts the strips down
or blocks into bent shapes like a small almanac of &mdash;&mdash;'s mustard
which I saw; (<em>b</em>) at putting shapes on to huge piles of sheets of
advertisements and labels, which are then pressed into the sheets by
a heavy top weight being brought down by steam. They were
doing some big "flies," on to which a string was to be put, so that
they could be whirled round and buzz.</p>

<p><em>Binding Room.</em>&mdash;There were only about 12 girls employed, but
there was room for 100, and they have them in at a press of work.
They do folding by hand in this firm for certain newspapers and all
sorts of advertisements. Wire stitching is also done. They were
folding various things, packing up labels, and so on, when I was
there.</p>

<p>REGULARITY.&mdash;The firm's trade fluctuates, but by no regular fixed
seasons; they are always busy before Christmas.</p>

<p>HEALTH.&mdash;I was told that it was quite a mistake to think bronzing
unhealthy. The manager stated he had known men at it for months
at a time without any evil effects. They sometimes imagined themselves
ill, but he had never known of a single case of real illness.
They grumble at doing it, and pretend that they are afraid of it
because then they get extra money (1<i>s.</i> extra a week). They really
object to it because it is bad for clothes&mdash;as you get covered with
dust&mdash;and uncomfortable to be all powdered with gold.</p>

<p>He had a machine below on which most work was done, except
when there was a great press. Messrs. &mdash;&mdash; gave him out so many
thousand to do; he could not do them fast enough with only one
machine, and it was not worth while having more than one as he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
not work enough ordinarily. No dust escaped from the machine.
As a proof of the healthiness of bronzing he said that he stood for three
or four hours in the middle of it all, "keeping them to their work"
(which they want), and got all covered over with the dust himself.
"You wouldn't get a manager doing that himself if it were unhealthy."
He always gave his bronzers one pint of milk a day to drink, he
stated with pride.</p>

<p>The other work, folding, card mounting, etc., was all quite healthy.
Indeed, work was unhealthy more on account of bad ventilation than
of any circumstance belonging to itself; he always had the window
open and a board put across the bottom, 6 ins. high, on the most
approved plan. The workpeople grumbled very much and tried to
paste up every crevice with brown paper, but they could not shut it.
They objected to the incandescent burners which he put in, for they
liked the heat of the gas and missed it.</p>

<p>DANGERS.&mdash;Occasionally girls catch their skirts in wheels and so
on, but there are never any "bad accidents." "With people of that
class it is 'funk' more than pain that they suffer; they will turn as
white as anything from just a little flesh wound with a cog-wheel."
The Factory Inspectors were very fussy about fencing machinery, he
thought. He told me long stories about men's carelessness and
how the boys would sit on the edge of the lift. He fined them 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
for it.</p>

<p>HOURS.&mdash;The hours are about 54 a week, from 8 a.m. to 6.30 p.m.,
with one hour for dinner. The women are allowed by the forewomen
to have lunch in the middle of the morning and tea in the afternoon,
and when the men are industrious the manager has no objection to
their taking "snacks." If it is an idler, he objects.</p>

<p>When busy, the work continues till 8 p.m. He had not used
special exemption once the last year.</p>

<p>PROSPECTS.&mdash;There are no prospects except for the girls in the
binding room. The present forewoman ("a jewel") had been with
the firm for thirty years; one or two others whom she had trained
could take her place.</p>

<p>ORGANISATION.&mdash;He had no knowledge of any Women's Unions
covering the women employed here. This is a Society house in
every branch for the men, but the manager said, "Trades Unionism
is all humbug," and he would like to do away with it altogether, if
possible; but it is so strong in London that if you want to get good
men you must be a Society house.</p>

<p>MARRIED AND UNMARRIED.&mdash;He employed 2 or 3 married women
amongst litho feeders. The firm ask no questions, but he said he
knew most of the workers.</p>

<p>A lot of the job hands were married, but none of the regular hands
in binding room.</p>

<p>LEGISLATION.&mdash;In manager's opinion legislation had not in any way
injured the position of women workers. It did not affect him at all.
He never employed men to fold at night, because it would not pay.
Occasionally, when the litho machines had to be kept working late,
he had to draft in men from other departments to feed them, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
could understand that a small printer, without different departments,
would find it awkward.</p>

<p>He would not himself have the place open at night with girls
working in it. He would not take the responsibility of that; they
would "lark about, etc." He thought it all to the women's advantage
that they must not work at night.</p>

<p>The intentions of the Factory Acts are good, and he approved of
them in principle, but there was a lot of humbug about them and
the L.C.C. regulations,<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> <i>e.g.</i>, making him have six basins for lavatory
for his workers. They never used more than two, preferring to follow
each other, and they broke the others, and then round came the
inspector and said you must have six.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_95" id="Footnote_95"></a><a href="#FNanchor_95"><span class="label">[95]</span></a> This is allowed to stand as an indication of the frequent misunderstandings
our investigators met with regarding the L.C.C. This body appeared to be
charged with everything that caused irritation.</p></div>

<p>The L.C.C. put a premium on burglary by making it compulsory
to have a way out on to the roof. The Factory Inspector was not
a practical man, and ordered a great deal of unnecessary fencing of
machinery. He told me how one night he kept the girls late
without giving notice (the work came in unexpectedly), and sat by
the telephone so as to send up notice to the forewoman if the
inspector came. It was not the Factory Acts which kept women
from being compositors.</p>

<p>MEN AND WOMEN.&mdash;Women did litho artists' work at home, and
there was no reason why they should not be quite as good at it as
men. It was paid by the merits of the sketch.</p>

<p><em>Feeding Litho Machines.</em>&mdash;He used to have boys, and a few years
ago introduced girls. They were much better at it, cleaner, quieter,
and more careful to place the paper exactly than boys.</p>

<p>He still had boys for <em>feeding letter-press machines</em>&mdash;why, he did not
quite know, except that it was the custom; then, having thought
about it, he said further, that it was because less care was needed.
Girls were no cheaper than the boys were, and were introduced
solely on account of being better workers.</p>

<p>He had no women compositors, and employed only 12 men,
and he did not see how he could work the two together, though he
did not see why women should not do all the setting-up and the
display work, though they could not lift the formes. He did not think
the Union objected. It never had been the custom though.</p>

<p>He never had women to work <em>cutting machines</em>. The men would
object.</p>

<p>Women never rose to mind the <em>printing litho machines</em>; he did not
think they could do it.</p>

<p>He had only one <em>platen machine</em>, worked and fed by a boy; but
in some places, where cheap things were done by this machine,
<i>e.g.</i>, paper bags, girls attended to it.</p>

<p>Men used to do <em>folding</em> in his youth, and they still did <em>stationers'
folding</em>, notepaper, etc., in some houses.</p>

<p>HOME WORK.&mdash;The firm gave out a certain amount of folding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>when there was a press of work. The forewoman knew of old hands
and others who could do it at home. He considered that to be quite
a convenient arrangement.</p>

<p>INFLUENCE ON FAMILY INCOME.&mdash;Many of the job hands were
married women, who liked to come out occasionally for a few extra
shillings. Others were single girls, who preferred to be paid by the
piece, and go about from house to house, making as much as time
workers for shorter hours.</p>



<h4>
<span>10. <em>Paper Colouring and Enamelling Firm
 in London, also engaged in
Showcard Mounting and Varnishing and Book-edge Gilding.
Employer's and Manager's Information.</em>
</span>
</h4>

<p>Both were very communicative. The former, after repeated
questions from me as to how things were done, took me over the
whole place, intending only to show me the varnishing, and finally
letting me see everything. He is a working-class master who has
risen. His father had a small business, and he has made it a big
one. It is one of the biggest firms in the trade.</p>

<p>TRAINING.&mdash;<em>Card Mounting.</em>&mdash;The firm indentures apprentices, who
agree to stay three or four years. They are taken on at fourteen
years of age, and are paid 4<i>s.</i> a week for the first year, and then
receive a portion of their piece work earnings, varying according to
efficiency, from one-fourth, one-half, three-fourths, two-thirds, and
so on, according to skill. They come for a month first to see if
they suit.</p>

<p><em>Paper Colouring and Enamelling.</em>&mdash;In this department apprentices
are also indentured for two years. They are taken on at fourteen,
and are paid 4<i>s.</i> a week first year, then a portion of their piece
earnings as above.</p>

<p><em>Varnishing and Sizing.</em>&mdash;No training is given for this. Girls must
be tall, or they are no use. Any girl will be "good at it" after
three weeks.</p>

<p>The employer remarked that parents could not afford to pay a
premium. It was very provoking when girls went off after four
years, when a lot of trouble had been spent in teaching them. I was
shown some cards which a girl, who was supposed to be competent,
had spoilt by pasting the sheet on so that there was a blister;
385 out of 500 were similarly spoilt, and they cost 6<i>d.</i> each, he
said.</p>

<p>WAGES.&mdash;<em>Card Mounting and Paper Colouring.</em>&mdash;Piece work rates are
paid here, with overtime at the same rate. It is difficult to give an
average. One girl would make 25<i>s.</i>, while another girl would only
make 7<i>s.</i> at the same work in the same time. After consideration,
the head gave it as his opinion that 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week would be what
the ordinary girl would earn, taking the whole year round, slack
with busy times. They were kept on all the year at this firm.
Sometimes a girl would make as much as 28<i>s.</i></p>

<p>It was further stated that a girl might make 6<i>d.</i> in less than an
hour at night, when the colours were mixed and she was finishing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
job, whereas it might take her a whole morning to earn the 6<i>d.</i> next
day.</p>

<p>A quick girl could do 1,000 eyelets in an hour, eyeletting being
paid at 10<i>d.</i> per 1,000.</p>

<p><em>Varnishing and Sizing.</em>&mdash;Piece work wages are paid here, with
overtime at same rates. Wages are reckoned by the lump sum for
the gross work done, and divided equally amongst all the hands.
The division is made by the firm, not the workers. We asked one
girl what she took last week, and she said 14<i>s.</i>; but my guide said
that the average would not be so high for the year, say 12<i>s.</i></p>

<p>WORK.&mdash;There are four separate departments or businesses here,
in three of which the work is done by women.</p>

<p><em>Varnishing and Sizing</em>, where 16 girls are employed. The
calendars, advertisements, and so on, to be varnished are placed in
a pile on a table underneath the long webbing band, and a girl sits
there and feeds. They are caught up and passed round rollers,
and are sized or varnished as the case may be. Another girl stands
facing the machine, seeing that they pass round all right. They
are then carried over the top of the top roller along the webbing
band, which stretches the full length of the room, till they come to
the drum at the end, round which the band passes on its return
journey. There girls take them off and place them in racks, the
bottom one of which is on a small trolley. When a big pile of racks
(about 5½ ft. high) is filled the girls wheel it off, lift up a door, and
push it into a big cupboard which takes up all the middle of the
room, and above which is a fan. There they are left to dry, and
when dry the girls wheel them out again and take out the sheets.</p>

<p>There were two rooms in which this was being done, with about
8 girls in each. There was also a third room at the side, where
they make up odds and ends, <i>e.g.</i>, make up packets of "Happy
Families," fold odd papers, eyelet a few things, and so on. There
was only 1 girl in this; sometimes there are several. When a
girl comes in first she does this work.</p>

<p><em>Card Mounting.</em>&mdash;About 30 or 40 girls were employed at this.
This consists in putting the advertisements, calendars, and so on,
on to the big sheets of cardboard and finishing them off. There
are various different processes. The board has to be cut, and this
is done either by a man or a girl who feeds the rotary cutting
machine. The sheet of card is "lined," <i>i.e.</i>, the back pasted on, and
edges pasted over if required. Then the picture (or calendar) that
is to go on it is pasted down, the girls covering the backs of about
four pictures (or calendars), and then pressing them down one after
another. For some work eyelets are then punched, and in the best
work the edges are bevelled by a little machine consisting of a wheel
in a trough, along which the edge is pushed. In the case of a good
deal of School Board work there is a narrow band of tin or brass at
the top which finishes it off, and out of which comes a brass loop
by which to hang it up. The men cut the brass into slips, and the
girls work about five hand machines, the principle of which is that
you put in your map (<i>e.g.</i>), put the tin or brass slip of metal in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
right position, pull down a handle, lift it up, and the work comes out
with the metal band pressed down on each side and the loop fixed
in the middle. For other work, such as big maps, charts, diagrams,
and so on, wooden rods are used as rollers, etc., and the work of
fastening is done by girls.</p>

<p><em>Paper Colouring and Enamelling by Hand.</em>&mdash;Only 12 women were
engaged upon this work&mdash;a considerable decrease. The sheet of
paper to be coloured is placed in front of the girl, who then wets
it over with the colour (black when I saw it) by means of a brush
like a whitewash brush (the manager said that they were whitewash
brushes with the handles taken off), which she dips into a bowl.
She then takes another round brush, about 10 ins. in diameter,
and brushes over the whole surface, so that the colour lies quite
evenly. The sheet of paper is then hung, as it were, on to a clothes
line to dry. These lines stretch over the room.</p>

<p>Enamelling is done in identically the same way, only it is enamel,
not colour, which is put on.</p>

<p>Enamelled paper is the very shiny coloured paper used for end
pages of books, for covering confectionery and similar boxes, etc.</p>

<p>Marbling is never done by this firm. All the coloured paper is in
plain colours, marbling being a quite different process.</p>

<p><em>Book-edge Gilding.</em>&mdash;Only men are employed in this.</p>

<p>REGULARITY.&mdash;The <em>card mounting</em> department is specially busy
before Christmas with calendars, almanacs, etc., but advertisement
cards are turned out all the year.</p>

<p><i>Paper colouring</i> comes in rushes, but is not a seasonal trade.</p>

<p><em>Varnishing</em> is sometimes busier at one time than at another, but it
is not seasonal. The work of this firm is such that no job hands
are employed.</p>

<p>HEALTH.&mdash;<em>Paper Colouring and Enamelling.</em>&mdash;Mr. &mdash;&mdash; called down
one woman who had worked there fourteen years, and her mother
before her. She looked very strong and healthy. The other girls
were not so robust looking as she, but did not look <em>ill</em>. One was
sitting in one of the colouring rooms during the dinner hour, her
hands all coated over with paint, eating bread and butter. Mr. &mdash;&mdash;
rebuked her and told her that she ought to wash her hands, and that
he was always telling her to do so, but she did not obey, and went on
eating stolidly.</p>

<p>The colouring girls were all splashed over, and so were the walls.
The rooms were close and dirty. Work was done standing.</p>

<p><em>Card Mounting.</em>&mdash;The rooms were close and dirty, and the work
seemed tiring.</p>

<p><em>Varnishing and Sizing.</em>&mdash;The smell and heat were enough to knock
one down when one first went in, though one ceased to notice it after
a bit. There are hot pipes connected with the machine to dry the
papers. The place looked very dirty, and my guide showed me how
the dust all stuck to any varnish about, so that the racks, if left out
for a day, got covered with flue. The girls did not look strikingly
unhealthy. They have to drag heavy loads about. One or two
looked a bit pale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>QUALIFICATIONS.&mdash;I should judge that strength was required for all
three departments, as girls are standing all day. Only tall girls are
taken in the varnishing room; short ones would be no good for
moving about the racks. The head said that no great intelligence
was wanted for any department, but a good deal of "perseverance"
for card mounting and paper colouring. If girls are careless at
card mounting they spoil the whole thing.</p>

<p>DANGERS.&mdash;The only machinery was the varnishing machine, and
the firm had never had any accident with it, and there seemed no
reason why there should be any. If girls are careless they are
dismissed. The employer considered the Compensation Act to be
very unfair: "If a girl slips on your iron staircase because her
shoelace was undone, you have to pay her."</p>

<p>HOURS.&mdash;The hours worked are from 9 a.m. to 7.30 p.m., with
one hour for dinner and half an hour for tea; on Saturdays from
9 a.m. to 1 p.m. On a board a notice was put up stating that
work begins as follows: 9 a.m. for women, 8 a.m. for boys, 7 a.m.
for men.</p>

<p>PROSPECTS.&mdash;There is 1 girl in the <em>varnishing</em> department who gets
"a trifle more than the others," owing to her skill. In <em>card mounting</em>
there are no prospects. A foreman manages the <em>paper colouring</em>
department, so that there is no chance of the women becoming forewomen.
The firm once tried a forewoman, but she was not a success.
She could not match the colours properly, etc. Mr. &mdash;&mdash; and
the robust worker seemed to think such a thing beyond a woman's
power (especially the latter, who scorned the idea of a forewoman).</p>

<p>ORGANISATION.&mdash;The head did not know if there was a Union or
not. "They do not give us any trouble."</p>

<p>MARRIED AND UNMARRIED.&mdash;Only 1 or 2 married women were
employed by the firm, and they were confined to the colouring
department. One married woman had been there fourteen years.</p>

<p>LEGISLATION.&mdash;My informant did not consider that legislation had
injured the woman worker at all, but had benefited her by lessening
her hours of labour. Legislation was very hard on him, however,
especially in the paper colouring and varnishing work. "A customer
comes in with some work at 1 o'clock on a Saturday. You say you
cannot do it till Monday. 'Well,' he says, 'I shall get it done elsewhere.'
People working at home are found to do it, and as they
have not got the machinery or appliances it means that they work at
it all Sunday, and make their little children of nine or ten work too,
whereas the grown women may not work an hour longer in factories."
Mr. &mdash;&mdash; evidently feels bitterly about this. It would not pay to keep
men on this kind of work. He would like more than thirty days a
year exemption for overtime. Besides, the girls would often like to
make a few shillings extra overtime. This was corroborated by the
paper-staining girl.</p>

<p>MEN AND WOMEN.&mdash;In the head's youth men used to do all the
card mounting; women were introduced for it about twenty-eight
years ago. They were brought in because the men drank so and
kept away from work. Men used to do paper colouring and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
varnishing, too, and were replaced by women for the same reason.
The Unions gave no trouble about this.</p>

<p>No women were employed in book-edge gilding by this firm.
Mr. &mdash;&mdash; and an old man employee said that some people got their
wives to help lay-on the gold and so on, but it did not come to much.</p>

<p>MACHINERY.&mdash;<em>Paper colouring and enamelling</em> machinery has diminished
women's work <em>considerably</em>. The head used to have 45 women
at it&mdash;two whole floors&mdash;and now only has 11. It is done by
machinery elsewhere. A certain amount is still done by hand, and
must always be, as it is not worth while putting anything under five
reams on a machine.</p>

<p><em>Varnishing.</em>&mdash;The head invented the present machines because
the women kept away so. There used to be many more women in
the trade.</p>

<p><em>Card Mounting.</em>&mdash;No machines are employed for this. Girls can
feed the rotary cutting machine, but it is generally done by a man.</p>

<p>HOME WORK.&mdash;No work is sent out from here. A good deal of
paper colouring and of varnishing is done by people in their own
homes (see under "Legislation").</p>

<p>FAMILY INCOME.&mdash;Very little information on this subject could be
had here. One girl in the varnishing room was pointed out to me,
dressed in black, whose father had recently died. She was the
eldest of eleven, and was "keen on picking up an extra shilling
or two."</p>

<p>GENERAL.&mdash;The whole place was dirty, and there was hardly a
vacant inch to squeeze past in. Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, however, did not seem a
bad sort of man; the girls did not seem in the least in awe of him.
All the girls looked of the regular factory girl type, sloppy and dirty,
and with their hair in curlers or curl papers.</p>

<p>Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, the paper stainer, who came down to talk to me,
seemed a friendly, rough-and-ready, low-class woman. Her mother
worked in the trade, and when she herself was a baby her cradle
was rocked on the colouring board, and "many is the night" that
she sat up all night as a child helping her mother at home. She
seemed to have thriven on it, and to be immensely proud of her
industrial career.</p>



<h4>
<span>11. <em>Bookbinding Firm,
West End, London. Employée's Evidence.</em></span>
</h4>



<p>WORK.&mdash;Trade in the West End is quite different to that in City
firms. This employée picked to pieces and sewed.</p>

<p>REGULARITY.&mdash;Hers was not a seasonal trade. She was busy all
the year round, but in January and July there was a special press,
owing to the number of magazine volumes then being bound.</p>

<p>HOURS.&mdash;She worked 48 per week, the length of the ordinary day
being from 8.30 a.m. to 6 p.m.</p>

<p>PROSPECTS.&mdash;She had never known anyone who rose to be a forewoman,
but supposed some did rise. Girls from West End shops
could not be City forewomen because they knew nothing about
machines, and in all advertisements for forewomen knowledge of
sewing machines was put as a necessary qualification.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>GENERAL.&mdash;I asked why their hours were so much shorter than
dressmakers, and have come to the conclusion that it was because
the men had got an eight-hours' day. She said this class of workers
in City shops is lower than in these West End places, and yet in the
City workplaces the best industrial training is given.</p>



<h4>
<span>12. <em>Bookbinding Firm in London.
 Employée's Evidence.</em></span>
</h4>


<p>WORK.&mdash;Works at a large place about five minutes' walk away
(not the same place where she learned). There are four rooms of
women. N. M. works in a room on the third floor, where there are
80 women under two forewomen, sisters. In this room folding,
stitching, gathering and sewing (hand) is done.</p>

<p>In the fourth room there are 12 girls doing machine sewing.</p>

<p>The two lower floor rooms each have about 10 or 12 girls. In
one of them laying-on of gold is done.</p>

<p>She herself does stitching, folding and gathering, hardly ever
sewing.</p>

<p>REGULARITY.&mdash;Orders are very slack sometimes, especially just
now (August). There had been a great deal of sitting idle, and they
had only been making 6<i>s.</i> or 7<i>s.</i> per week. They did not like to go
"out to grass" for fear of losing work if it should chance to come in.
It was difficult to get off for a holiday. Sometimes they were told
at 1 p.m. that they could go home.</p>

<p>HEALTH.&mdash;<em>Gold laying-on</em> was unhealthy. The dust got on the
chest. <em>Folding</em> and <em>Sewing</em> were very tiring, because "you are
sitting in one position all day." <em>Gathering</em> is the most pleasant,
because you walk about and get a little exercise that way.</p>

<p>PROSPECTS.&mdash;There is not much chance of rising. The forewoman
and under-forewoman are sisters, and stay on and on. If
one of them were to give up, her successor would be taken from the
time workers. The piece workers might rise to be time workers, if
they cared.</p>


<h4>
<span>13. <em>Bookbinding Firm in London.
Employée's Evidence.</em></span>
</h4>


<p>WORK.&mdash;This informant was engaged at gold laying-on exclusively,
but was originally a folder and sewer.</p>

<p>REGULARITY.&mdash;In this firm it is a seasonal trade, and slack sometimes
as well. She left M. because of slackness.</p>

<p>HEALTH.&mdash;It is not very healthy. Layers-on cannot have the
windows open because of the draught blowing the gold about, also
the gas used for "blocking" overheats the rooms. Girls sometimes
faint three or four times a day, and get anæmic. After working
overtime at &mdash;&mdash;'s would often stagger in the streets. "You have
to drink a lot of tea to keep you up."</p>

<p>HOURS.&mdash;48 a week is about the normal working time, from 9 a.m.
to 7 p.m., with one hour for dinner and half an hour for tea, as at M.,
and 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Saturdays; or else from 8.30 a.m. to 6 p.m.,
as at N., with one hour for dinner, and 8.30 a.m. to 12 noon on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
Saturdays. She preferred 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., because then she got a
tea half-hour. "One got so faint going on till 6.30 p.m. from 2 p.m."</p>

<p>At O. there was a great deal of overtime; not at M.</p>

<p>PROSPECTS.&mdash;She could have been a sort of forewoman at sixteen
over 6 other girls at P., but an older hand persuaded her not to; and
being ignorant of the ways of the world she agreed not to, and then
the older hand became forewoman herself! That was her only
chance of promotion.</p>



<h4>
<span>14. J., <em>Bookbinding Firm in London</em>. <em>Employée's Evidence and Visit

</h4>


<p>Work.&mdash;Folding, numbering, perforating, sewing. The regular
staff do all, but the firm take in job hands for folding only, when
busy.</p>

<p>REGULARITY.&mdash;The regular hands are kept on all the year round.</p>

<p>HOURS.&mdash;The hours worked average 54 a week, from 8.30 a.m. to
7.30 p.m. My informant said they were "obliged by the Factory Act<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
to have half an hour for lunch from 11 a.m. to 11.30 a.m., but they
did not take more than a quarter of an hour, or else they ate whilst
working;" dinner from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m., and tea from 5 p.m. to
5.30 p.m. On Saturdays the hours are 8.30 a.m. to 2 p.m., with
11 a.m. to 11.30 a.m. for lunch.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_96" id="Footnote_96"></a><a href="#FNanchor_96"><span class="label">[96]</span></a> This, of course, is incorrect.</p></div>

<p>PROSPECTS.&mdash;The girls may rise to forewomen. One who had just
risen quickly to that position was going off to be married.</p>

<p>GENERAL.&mdash;They can cook food on the premises at this firm.</p>



<h4>
<span>15. B., <em>Stationery Firm in London.
 Visit to Works.</em></span>
</h4>


<p>WORK.&mdash;About 150 to 200 women are employed.</p>

<p>(1) Hand folding and cementing of envelopes (includes putting
band round packet).</p>

<p>(2) Machine folding and cementing of envelopes (includes putting
band round packet).</p>

<p>(3) Black bordering.</p>

<p>(4) Stamping, plain and relief.</p>

<p>(5) Printing of addresses for circulars, etc. (small machines).</p>

<p>(6) Packing twelve packets in long packets and sample packing.</p>

<p>(7) Vellum sewing (folding, sewing, and looking over).</p>

<p>(8) Perforating (in same room).</p>

<p>(9) Machine ruling.</p>

<p>The number of women at each process in the part of factory seen
were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) About 27, (2) 30, (3) 1, (4) 4 stamping, (5) about 8, (6) 3 and 1
sample packer (probably many more), (7) 4 sewing, 1 looking over,
2 hanging about, (8) 1, (9) 4.</p>

<p>There are 42 other workers who are all older hands.</p>

<p>The girls employed in (1) are a superior grade to those in (2)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
and will not mix at all. Wages about the same. (3), (4), (5), (6), (7)
and (8) are more or less same grade as (1); (9) are lower than (2).</p>

<p>REGULARITY.&mdash;The work here is steady all the year round.</p>

<p>HEALTH.&mdash;All the girls are healthy, and the work is quite healthy.</p>

<p>HOURS.&mdash;They work 51 hours per week.</p>

<p>PROSPECTS.&mdash;Envelope hand folders can rise to be cementers or
forewomen (envelope hand folders being themselves a superior class
to machine folders or machine rulers); packers can rise to be sample
packers.</p>



<h4>
<span>16. R., <em>Stationery Firm (Christmas Cards, etc.) in London</em>. <em>Visit to
Works.</em></span>
</h4>


<p>WORK.&mdash;There are three departments:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) <em>Relief Stamping</em>, with 20 regular hands. These girls work the
presses, which are of the newest kind, and some of which are very
heavy. They do monograms and all sorts of designs on menus,
wedding cards, Christmas cards, ball cards, etc., and stamp in gold,
silver, or colours.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Hand Painting</em>, with 21 regular hands. This means filling in
stamped-out or printed designs of various kinds of cards with colour,
<i>e.g.</i>, figures of soldiers, flowers, and so on.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Packing Department</em>, with about 12 regular hands. They do up
the cards in packets, fold and gum special wedding envelopes, paste
pictures on to cards, tie the little ribbon bows on cards, and do all
the many little processes required for finishing this kind of work.</p>

<p>REGULARITY.&mdash;The work of this firm is very seasonal. The busy
time is for about three months before Christmas, but they are
specially rushed for the six weeks before Christmas. The regular
hands are kept on all the year round, but about 25 or 30 extra are
employed for the packing room for six weeks before Christmas. In
the other departments they get a few married hands just to come in
and help. They are now (July) preparing books of Christmas cards,
but the orders for private Christmas cards do not come in till
November and December.</p>

<p>The girls who work in the packing room pack scents, etc., at other
times of the year.</p>

<p>HEALTH.&mdash;The work is quite healthy and the girls all appeared to
be healthy. The premises were light and airy. Two of the relief
stamping presses <em>looked</em> very heavy indeed, and the forewoman said
that they were really men's work. The girls working them always
had the same machines, and did not look ill, though they said that
it was very tiring.</p>

<p>Machinery.&mdash;Machinery has not displaced women in this firm.</p>

<p>HOURS.&mdash;For <em>stamping and packing</em> the hours are from 9 a.m. to
6.30 p.m. with three-quarters of an hour for dinner and a quarter of an
hour for tea; on Saturdays, from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., with half an hour
for lunch. For <em>painting</em> they are from 9 a.m. to 5.45 p.m., with the
same meal hour; on Saturdays, from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.</p>

<p>The hours of painters had been shortened about a year ago, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
was found that they did just as much work. For the six weeks before
Christmas they regularly work from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., with as much
overtime as is allowed, <i>i.e.</i>, three nights a week.</p>

<p>PROSPECTS.&mdash;They may rise to forewomen; <i>e.g.</i>, the forewoman
over the stampers came as an ordinary hand.</p>

<p>GENERAL.&mdash;There is a dining room, and every girl can pay 3<i>s.</i> a
week and get dinner of meat and pudding and tea every day. This
covers all expenses, wages of cook, gas for stove, all utensils, etc.
Last year there was money over, so they had free meals for a week.</p>



<h4>
<span>17. G., <em>Large Stationery Firm in London.
Visit to Works.</em></span>
</h4>



<p>WORK.&mdash;About 60 girls are employed. <em>Stationery and Printing</em>
with following divisions:&mdash;(1) Plain cameo and relief stamping
(about 25 girls), (2) illuminating, <i>i.e.</i>, putting on the colour by hand
(2 girls), (3) envelope folding and cementing (9 girls), (4) packing,
including cleaning (girls in each department), (5) folding notepaper
(saw 3 little girls doing this), (6) feeding printing machines, big and
small, and lithographic machines (about 6 girls), (7) various odd jobs,
<i>e.g.</i>, cutting visiting cards to proper size, (8) feeding ruling machine
(1 girl).</p>

<p>REGULARITY.&mdash;This firm's trade is regular. They are busy all the
year round, though perhaps they are busiest at Christmas. The
bulk of their orders come from the country though.</p>

<p>HEALTH.&mdash;The little printing and lithographic girls looked anything
but healthy.</p>

<p>MACHINERY.&mdash;Machines have not displaced women. There was
nothing dangerous about the machinery used, though the small
printing machine which 1 girl was feeding <em>might</em> be dangerous.</p>

<p>HOURS.&mdash;The hours worked are from 8.30 a.m. to 7 p.m., with one
hour for dinner and half an hour for tea; on Saturdays, from 8.30 a.m.
to 1 p.m. They work overtime at Christmas.</p>

<p>WORK.&mdash;<em>Numbering and Perforating</em>; girls also dust and clean
up after blocking.</p>

<p>REGULARITY.&mdash;The work in this firm is regular, "as they work for
the trade."</p>

<p>SKILL.&mdash;Intelligence is required for numbering, or else valuable
material is spoilt, <i>e.g.</i>, the other day a girl, who was six months out
of her time, never changed when she came to the 1,000 and so spoilt
the work, as one figure came out darker. Three numbers are harder
to do than two or four. The firm had tried to take two girls from
the blocking work and teach them numbering, but it was no good,
they were not intelligent enough.</p>

<p>HOURS.&mdash;The hours worked are from 9 a.m. to 7.30 p.m., with one
hour for dinner, ten minutes for lunch, and ten minutes for tea; on
Saturdays, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.</p>

<p>PROSPECTS.&mdash;The girls can rise to be forewomen.</p>

<h4>
<span>19. I., <em>Stationery and Stamping Firm in
London. Employee's Evidence.</em></span>
</h4>


<p>WORK.&mdash;Stamping, plain and relief, including tradesmen's cards,
notepaper, Christmas cards, etc.</p>

<p>REGULARITY.&mdash;The work here is regular, because they work for
the trade.</p>

<p>SKILL.&mdash;The girls need arm strength. Artistic taste is also
required. Some never make good stampers on account of deficiency
in taste.</p>

<p>MACHINERY.&mdash;Machinery has not displaced women.</p>

<p>HOURS.&mdash;The hours worked are from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., with one
hour for dinner, and half an hour for tea; on Saturdays, from 9 a.m.
to 1 p.m.</p>

<p>PROSPECTS.&mdash;Girls may rise to forewomen. "There is a little girl
of fifteen now, who has only been here a year, and the other day
Mr. I. (who does not say things when he does not mean them) told
her that she would rise to be forewoman one day. She is very good
at her work and knows how things should look."</p>

<p>GENERAL.&mdash;The girls are very comfortable here. They have a
room to themselves upstairs, and a dining room and a stove to
cook on.</p>

and shuffling.</p>

<p>(2) Envelope cementing.</p>

<p>(3) Plain stamping.</p>

<p>(4) Relief stamping.</p>

<p>(5) Looking over and packing.</p>

<p>REGULARITY.&mdash;Slack times vary in different houses. "You never
can tell," but summer, as a rule, is slack. Last summer there was
very little work all July and August at C. and D. and F. She
made only 8<i>d.</i> or 9<i>d.</i> a day sometimes.</p>

<p>HOURS.&mdash;At C. and D. the hours worked are from 9 a.m. to
7 p.m., with one and a-half hours for meals; at E., from 8 a.m. to
6.30 p.m., with one and a-half hours for meals on Monday and
Tuesday; from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., with one and a-half hours for meals
on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday; and from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m.
on Saturdays.</p>

<p>MACHINERY.&mdash;Machinery has not taken work from women.</p>

<p>GENERAL.&mdash;She remarked that G. was "a dreadful place." The
girls cried because there was no work.</p>


<h4>
<span>21. X., <em>Stamping Firm in London. Employee's Evidence.</em></span>
</h4>



<p>WORK.&mdash;There are about 100 girls in the <em>stamping</em> room, about
30 of whom pack up the work in boxes, etc. In some places the
stampers have to pack their own work. There is also <em>envelope work</em>,
etc., done on the firm, but my informant knew nothing of this. Some
girls did the hand illuminating, <i>i.e.</i>, colouring part of a design that
has been stamped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>REGULARITY.&mdash;The trade is seasonal, and is slack in the summer
and busy in winter.</p>

<p>SKILL.&mdash;"You have to be strong to stand the stamping," she said.
She herself had to give it up after she had been a learner for two
years, and take to packing. Her health gave way; she got very
anæmic, and could not stand the strain. Most of the packers were
girls who could not stand stamping. They had one very heavy press
with big dies, and tried a girl on it, but she got injured internally, so
a man was put on it. At R. she heard they had heavy presses. She
said she knew of two girls who went there, and both injured themselves.
She thinks they had to go to the hospital. The best paying
work was done on the big presses. However, many girls stood the
stamping all right. Strength is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>HOURS.&mdash;The hours worked are from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., with one
and a-half hours off for meals; on Saturdays, from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m.
When busy they work regularly from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., and three
nights a week to 9.30 p.m.</p>


<h4>
<span>22 and 23. U. and V., <em>Two Stamping Firms in London</em>.
<em>Employee's Evidence.</em></span>

<p>WORK.&mdash;My informant did plain stamping, but never learnt relief
work. She once tried it, but did not get on with it. At U. there
were only 5 stampers, at V. quite 30.</p>

<p>REGULARITY.&mdash;At U. work came in rushes, and they were always
either very busy or else very slack; at V. work was steady all the
year.</p>

<p>HEALTH.&mdash;My informant herself had grown rather crooked, and
had to leave off work. She did not know of any other girls similarly
affected though, nor did she consider it unhealthy. A good many
were anæmic. She thought that now she has had a rest she might
be able to stand it better. The big dies were the bad ones, and
were tiring.</p>

<p>HOURS.&mdash;At U. the hours were from 9.15 a.m. to 7 p.m., with one
hour for dinner and half an hour for tea; at V. from 9.15 a.m. to
6.30 p.m., but at V. one could work till 7 or 7.30 p.m., if one cared.
At U. they were then working till 8 p.m. (December). She had
never worked later than 9, and that very rarely.</p>

<p>PROSPECTS.&mdash;She thought that the chance of rising to forewoman
was exceedingly remote.</p>

<p>GENERAL.&mdash;Both U. and V. were very nice and respectable shops,
and particular about whom they took on. At U. there was a dining
room, and things more comfortable than at V.</p>



<h4>
<span>24. Y., <em>Machine Ruling Firm in London.
Visit to Works.</em></span>
</h4>

<p>WORK.&mdash;There are <em>two departments</em>. (1) Top floor: <em>Machine ruling</em>.
(2) Ground floor: <em>Perforating</em>, <em>numbering</em>, <em>and paging.</em></p>

<p>(1) The following is the general principle of the ruling machine:</p>

<p>There is a band about 1 yd. wide which goes round and round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
in a large ellipse (one flat side of the ellipse is about 3½ yds.
long). Upon this band the sheets of paper are placed by the
girls, and by it they are drawn under a row of pens set at the required
intervals for the lines. They are then carried up and round by the
revolutions of the band&mdash;being held in their places by string which
revolves with the band&mdash;and fall out of the machine with the
ink dry.</p>

<p>A good many machines are fitted with a second row of pens which
rules the underneath side of the paper as well as the upper.</p>

<p>The pens are fed by a piece of flannel which is kept soaked by a
regular flow of ink from a vessel fitted with a small tap.</p>

<p>These machines are worked by power. They used to be worked
by hand.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Perforating</em> is done by a machine worked by a treadle. A
good many foreign and colonial postage stamps are done here.</p>

<p><em>Numbering</em> of loose pages, cheques, receipts, etc., is done by a
machine with a handle which has to be pulled down by hand.</p>

<p><em>Paging</em>, which is for made-up books, is done by a machine worked
by a treadle.</p>

<p>REGULARITY.&mdash;The summer is a slack season in this trade as a
rule. The firm are especially slack just now (August) as there are
no orders from South Africa.</p>

<p>HEALTH.&mdash;The upper floor was exceedingly, almost insupportably,
stuffy. The ground floor was fairly airy. The under-forewoman said
that working the treadle for paging was very hard work. "It always
upset her inside," so she had to give it up.</p>

<p>SKILL.&mdash;Strength is required for paging.</p>

<p>DANGER.&mdash;They had just had an accident with the perforating
machine. The bands upstairs were dangerous to long hair. One
girl had her hair caught and was carried right up to the ceiling.
The band was loose and slipped off the wheel, so she was let down
again with no great injury.</p>

<p>PROSPECTS.&mdash;The girls may rise to forewoman; the machine rulers
may rise to wet the flannels.</p>


<h4>
<span>25. <em>Paper Bag Making in London.
Employee's Evidence.</em></span>
</h4>


<p>WORK.&mdash;(1) Cake bags, (2) tea bags, (3) sugar bags. These are
different classes of work and some hands can do only one class.</p>

<p>The girls do their own cutting except for the very heavy work,
which men do. As a rule, the piece-rate girls make the bag right
through from the sheet, <i>i.e.</i>, cut the paper, lay it out and paste.
Tea bags are made on a tin. There were 150 girls working in the
room.</p>

<p>REGULARITY.&mdash;The work is irregular, but if a girl can do all kinds
it is better for her. "There is always some work, but sometimes
you may sit idle doing needlework most of the day."</p>

<p>HEALTH.&mdash;"It is very bad for you standing all day long," said my
informant. "Girls come in looking lively and healthy, but they
soon get run down." The standing and the used-up air are bad, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
latter especially in the winter-time when the gas is alight. She
herself has lost her health.</p>

<p>MACHINERY.&mdash;Machinery had not displaced women.</p>

<p>HOURS.&mdash;The hours are from 8 a.m. to 6.30 p.m., with one hour
for dinner, ten minutes for lunch, and twenty minutes for tea; on
Saturdays, from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. The girls have to be in by 8.15 or
they are locked out for the morning.</p>

<p>When at overtime they work from 8 a.m. to 9.30 p.m.</p>

<p>PROSPECTS.&mdash;The forewoman was at the bench once.</p>

<p>GENERAL.&mdash;"On the floor below," said my informant, "are litho
girls&mdash;not the sort whom you <em>could</em> speak to. That is a very bad
trade."</p>



<h4>
<span>26. <em>Printer's and Bookbinder's Firm in Leeds.
Employer's Information.</em></span>
</h4>


<p>I was shown over the factory. The rooms are all very large and
lofty. Electric instead of steam power is used, and so the factory is
far less noisy and cooler than most printing works.</p>

<p><em>One hundred and twenty girls</em> of a very superior class are employed.</p>

<p>The conditions under which work is carried on here are evidently
very good.</p>

<p>They print large advertisement posters, time-tables, magazines,
novels, and make account books, cheque books, etc.</p>

<p>TRAINING.&mdash;Girls begin by feeding ruling machines, packing, etc.,
and the length of their "apprenticeship" depends entirely upon the
girls themselves. They are put on piece work as soon as they are
fit for it; they are taken on about fourteen without premium, and
their wages begin at 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> or, sometimes, 5<i>s.</i>, and rise by degrees
till they are paid piece work rates.</p>

<p>WAGES.&mdash;<em>Folding and Sewing</em> (piece work).&mdash;The pay ranges about
10<i>s.</i>, 12<i>s.</i>, 16<i>s.</i>, up to 25<i>s.</i> per week.</p>

<p><em>Laying-on of Gold-leaf and Blockers</em> (piece work) yields 18<i>s.</i> to 20<i>s.</i>
per week.</p>

<p>Girls who put <em>paper covers</em> on to cheap novels, etc., earn about 20<i>s.</i></p>

<p><em>Layers-on</em> (<em>Letter-press and Litho</em>) are paid time wages and receive
8<i>s.</i>, 10<i>s.</i>, and 12<i>s.</i> per week.</p>

<p>The employer says he has known three sisters take home £4 a
week for several months in succession. He thinks it pays well to
give high wages.</p>

<p>HOURS.&mdash;The hours are 52½ per week: from 7.30 a.m. to 6 p.m.,
with dinner from 12.30 p.m. to 1.30 p.m.; on Saturdays, 7.30 a.m.
till 12.30 p.m.; but overtime is worked thirty days in the year.
Piece workers receive no extra pay; time workers get time and a
quarter.</p>

<p>WORK.&mdash;<em>Folding</em> is done chiefly by hand. There is one machine,
but that is self-feeding and a man minds it.</p>

<p><em>Sewing</em> is done by hand and by machinery.</p>

<p><em>Perforating</em> is done by a machine worked by power, which has
simply to be fed.</p>

<p>Several girls were employed putting the wrappers on to 6<i>d.</i> novels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
while others were pasting cloth on to cardboard for school exercise
books. Little girls were feeding the ruling machine, punching labels,
eyeletting and packing.</p>

<p>Girls were also engaged in gold laying-on and blocking, but none
were employed at this when I was there.</p>

<p>In the litho and letter-press printing rooms a large number of very
respectable girls, about eighteen years of age, were employed as
layers-on. They were feeding large as well as small machines.</p>

<p>REGULARITY.&mdash;The girls are employed all the year round, but they
are busier in the autumn and winter (from September to May). They
are also very busy the last week in each month. <em>Occasionally</em>, in June
and July, they only work half-time, but this does not happen often.</p>

<p>HEALTH.&mdash;The work is very healthy. Before they had electric
power the employer had seen girls fall down and faint when "laying-on"
at night when the gas was lit and the room hot. Now that they
have electric power and electric light such a thing never happens.</p>

<p>DANGER.&mdash;The use of electric power does away with the need of
belting shafts, etc. There is simply a small motor on the ground.</p>

<p>ORGANISATION.&mdash;There is no organisation amongst the women,
though the men are all Unionists.</p>

<p>MARRIED AND UNMARRIED.&mdash;Girls all leave when they get married.
Occasionally, when they are busy, an old hand who has got married
comes back, but 99 per cent. are unmarried. The employer did not
know whether they had any married women there then.</p>

<p>FACTORY LEGISLATION.&mdash;Factory legislation has in no way limited
the usefulness of women. Girls do not mind working overtime when
they can make a little extra by it, but the employer said "overtime
does not pay anybody." <i>E.g.</i>, when layers-on worked overtime they
were paid time and a quarter, and it did not pay to give that extra
money. The restriction of overtime to thirty days a year worked
out very inconveniently for the masters, but this employer thought
the factory legislation was a very good thing on the whole.</p>

<p>One direct result of factory legislation here has been the introduction
of a self-feeding folding machine worked by electric power, which
they use when they are busy instead of getting in extra hands or
working overtime. When not busy this machine stands idle, and
the folding is done by hand. Another result of factory legislation is
that they have to employ more hands than they otherwise would, and
so girls sometimes have to work short time.</p>

<p>MEN AND WOMEN.&mdash;The employer said there was a clearly drawn
line between men's work and women's work. The Union made a
great point of keeping women out of what they consider to be men's
work, and there would be a "row" amongst them if women were
put on, but I found out later on that girls do the laying-on and <em>gold
blocking</em> for the backs of books, etc. The employer said he put them
on to that about three years ago. At first the men made a fuss about
it, but it passed over. His reason for putting girls on was that it
was light work quite suitable for a girl. Only skilled girls did it.
They would get perhaps 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, time wage, while they were learning,
and then go on to piece work and earn 18<i>s.</i> or 20<i>s.</i> a week. A man's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
wage for the same work would be a minimum of 32<i>s.</i> a week (time),
as that is the Trade Union minimum, and the Trade Unionists
generally get something above the minimum.</p>

<p>This firm was the first in Leeds to introduce girls as layers-on for
letter-press and litho machines. That was about twenty years ago.
The reason was that it was impossible to apprentice the number of
boys required. The Trade Union regulation about the proportion
of apprentices to journeymen is very strictly enforced, and it was not
fair to employ boys and simply turn them off when they got older;
so girls were employed, and now the majority of layers-on are girls.
They do the work, on the whole, better than boys, and they are
steadier.</p>

<p>MACHINERY.&mdash;Machinery is continually being introduced and more
women are being employed in spite of the fact that the machines do
work so much more quickly. Production is made cheaper and so
the demand is greater.</p>

<p>HOME WORK.&mdash;No home work is given out.</p>


<h4>
<span><em>Relief Stamping Firms.
General Summary.</em></span>
</h4>


<p>We have information about twenty-one houses where women are
employed at stamping (covering over 300 women).</p>

<p>TRAINING.&mdash;Out of these nine have a regular system of training,
four do not take apprentices, having found them more trouble than
they were worth; three have no settled system, while three refused
to furnish information on the subject. In four cases indentures were
signed, and there were two cases of premiums, in one of which £2
was paid, to be returned with 5 per cent. interest after three years;
in the other, £10&mdash;with variations. "It varies with the girl," we
were told. "Sometimes girls with very respectable parents like to
pay a premium, in other cases it is waived." In eight out of the
nine houses where there is a regular system of training, the girls
serve an apprenticeship varying from two to three years. They
begin by a few shillings pocket-money and go on to receive a part
of what they make at piece work rates. In one house they gave from
two weeks to two months for nothing, during which time their
earnings went to the forewoman who taught them.</p>

<p>The following are some of the systems of payment during
training:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) 1st year (employed in warehouse), 3<i>s.</i>; 2nd year, half earnings,
piece, with 4<i>s.</i> per month pocket-money; 3rd year, three-quarter
earnings, with 4<i>s.</i> per month pocket-money.</p>

<p>(2) 1st year, 5<i>s.</i>; 2nd year, 6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; 3rd year, 8<i>s.</i></p>

<p>(3) 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for first 6 months; rising 1<i>s.</i> every 3 months, till 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
is reached.</p>

<p>(4) Start at 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; rise to 10<i>s.</i> during training.</p>

<p>(5) 1st year, half earnings; 2nd year, three-quarter earnings.</p>

<p>(6) 3<i>s.</i> or 4<i>s.</i> first 6 months; 5<i>s.</i> second 6 months; then 6<i>s.</i> for
2nd year.</p>

<p>(7) Pay £2 premium. Put on piece work almost at once and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
receive what they make. Premiums returned with 5 per cent.
interest after 3 years.</p>

<p>(8) 3 months, nothing; 3 months, 2<i>s.</i> per week; next 3 months,
3<i>s.</i>; next, 4<i>s.</i>; so on till 8<i>s.</i></p>

<p>One forewoman considered that three years' training was much too
long, and stated that there was a tendency in certain houses to do
work cheap by means of apprentices. She said that the girls in such
houses get disheartened and sick of work, and when they were out
of their time it was no use staying on, for all the work got given to
the learners. Some learners are quite quick by the end of three
weeks. We often found that when a girl came in to learn stamping
she was set to run about the warehouse or to do gumming for the
first year. This, it was urged by one employer, was done purely
from humane motives. Since the girls were often delicate when they
came in, it was far better for them to do odd jobs for a year than to
be stuck down at once at some sedentary occupation.</p>

<p>Learners are taken at thirteen or fourteen years of age. Sometimes
they are left to "pick things up." Sometimes they are taught
by a forewoman or experienced hand. The relief stamper belongs
to the upper class of factory girl.</p>

<p>REGULARITY.&mdash;Trade is tolerably steady. A few weeks in summer
are generally slack, and where there is Christmas card work the six
weeks before Christmas are extremely busy.</p>

<p>HEALTH.&mdash;We were told almost unanimously that stamping was
healthy work, and undoubtedly, where the presses are light, it is so.
Some of the presses, however, are very heavy, and the girls who
work them acknowledged that the work was extremely tiring. Most
houses have men to work their heaviest presses. We heard of
three cases in two different houses of internal strain to girls working
at these presses, and we heard of one house where the girls in the
packing room were recruited from those who could not stand the
stamping.</p>

<p>SKILL.&mdash;Skill is required for illuminating.</p>

<p>PROSPECTS.&mdash;In some cases it is possible to rise to forewoman,
or from plain to relief and cameo stamping and occasionally
illuminating.</p>

<p>WAGES.&mdash;Wages vary from 13<i>s.</i> to 25<i>s.</i> or 30<i>s.</i>, mostly piece work.
Some of the piece work rates were 9<i>d.</i> per 1,000 impressions, 2<i>d.</i> per
1,000 plain (2,000 can be done per hour); 10<i>d.</i> per ream one die
(takes two hours to do one ream), 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> per 1,000 impressions.</p>

<p>MARRIED AND UNMARRIED.&mdash;Very few relief stampers are married.
In some houses married women are not allowed, in some they
"come back to oblige" at busy times. In one house only we heard
"that many stampers marry, though they might as well not, as they
come back to work."</p>

<p>DISPLACEMENT.&mdash;Men used to do relief stamping, but women, owing
to the cheapness of their labour, have superseded them in all but the
heaviest work. For the heavy presses men are still employed, "but
it is a poor trade for them."</p>

<p>In some houses they do illuminating, as for this the women are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
found not to possess sufficient skill and patience. One large house
employs 4 men for a superior sort of relief stamping&mdash;gold and
silver on a coloured surface. The crest or monogram has to be
stamped in plain first, then coloured, then stamped with the gold or
silver by the men. This last process requires great skill and
accuracy and care, for if it is crooked by a hair's breadth the
thing is spoilt. Girls are stated not to be accurate and careful
enough for this work, although they are employed for the simpler
sort of gold stamping.</p>

<p>Where heavy hand machines have come in they have ousted
women. One employer considered that if stamping machines
worked by steam came in women would be employed on them.
In one house, however, where there was machine stamping, it was
done by men. We were told by a large employer that there is now
a new machine in the market which may supersede female labour.
It colours the surface first and then embosses it out. Another new
machine requires a feeder only, as the die is coloured, rubbed and
stamped down by machinery.</p>




<h4>
<span><em>Job Hands. Interview with Agent.</em></span>
</h4>


<p>Miss R., like Mrs. B. before her, apparently acts as a sort of
bureau-keeper for job hands; sometimes she has work in to do herself
and keeps a certain staff, at other times she gets a notice to say
that W. has got a big job and wants so many hands; she collects
them, sends postcards all round, and goes and works herself too.
Very few of her job hands would touch magazine work; they
usually work at prospectuses. Mrs. B. used to do all the work
for the &mdash;&mdash; Societies. There were hundreds of job hands, how
many she cannot tell at all.</p>

<p>REGULARITY.&mdash;The work is quite uncertain. "You never know
when there will be work; but July and August are usually the slack
months, but this year (1900-01) it has been slack all the year.
Job hands, however, do what they like when there is not work,
whereas constant hands have to come in and wait whether there
is work or not."</p>

<p>HEALTH.&mdash;It is hard work, but there is nothing unhealthy about it.</p>

<p>GENERAL.&mdash;She spoke with pitying contempt of the "constant"
hands and their low prices and the long hours they worked.</p>

<span><a name="APPENDIX_III" id="APPENDIX_III">APPENDIX III.</a></span>
<span>GENERAL GLASGOW REPORT.
</span></h2>

<h3>
<span>(A.) <em>Letterpress
 Printing. Machine Feeding and Flying.</em>
</span></h3>

<p>Girls are employed to "feed" the machines and to "take off"
the impressed sheet. A girl will learn "taking off," or "flying,"
in a couple of days; but except in the old-fashioned and smaller
jobbing-shops flying is now done entirely by machinery. Machine
feeding is not so easy and simple a process as it seems. The girls
stand and perform the same movement repeatedly, each time giving
to the sheet the precise swing required to send it accurately into
the grips. The work requires little intelligence, and the extent to
which it can be characterised as exhausting depends partly on the
speed of the machine, but chiefly on the length of the "run."
Three methods of treating the girls may be distinguished. In some
shops where there are very long runs, perhaps extending to a
couple of weeks, as in the case of the printing of low-priced Bibles,
the work is tiring. At the close of a long run the machines have
to be prepared afresh, and the girls enjoy a spell for a day or two.
This leisure they are sometimes inclined to abuse by interrupting
the work of others with conversation, and consequently attempts
are being made to employ them on other machines during the
interval. This innovation the girls are resisting. In other shops
the fatiguing nature of a long run is mitigated by removing the girl
to another machine with a different movement, but the "right" of
a girl to be so moved about and rested is not recognised; it is
simply a matter for the consideration of the foreman. To allow the
claim to frequent shifting might prove inconvenient in times of
pressure. Lastly, in establishments where the bulk of the work
involves short runs, as, for example, in printing the official matter
of a municipality or a college, the necessity for frequently preparing
the machines affords considerable leisure to the feeders. These
intervals explain the groups of girls often to be seen chatting and
knitting in odd corners of the machine-room. Some of these shops
recognise the right of a girl to feed and keep clean "her own
machine" and no other. Where this is the case a girl may be
employed feeding for no longer than a quarter of the normal working
week of fifty-two and a half hours owing to the shortness of the runs
and the length of time spent in re-adjustment. The work is dirty
but not dangerous, as all machinery is well-fenced, and accidents are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
of very rare occurrence. The day's work usually starts at 6.15 a.m.
and ends at 6 p.m., with meal hours at 9 and at 2 o'clock and half
an hour for tea when engaged on overtime. Saturday's shift is from
6.15 a.m. until 10 a.m. Girls are paid 5<i>s.</i>, in a few shops 6<i>s.</i>, a
week as beginners. They get their first rise in three months, and are
gradually advanced to an average wage of 10<i>s.</i>, while an expert feeder
may earn 11<i>s.</i>, or at the outside 12<i>s.</i>, a week. When girls find that
they can feed well after a comparatively short time in a shop and
that they are getting only 7<i>s.</i> or 8<i>s.</i> a week they commonly seek and
obtain the average wage elsewhere. Managers fancy "it would not
do" to advance a girl abruptly from 6<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i> a week in the same
shop, but do not blame the girls for leaving. "It is human nature."
Girls are taken on at any age after fourteen, and stay on till they are
married or until they are called away to domestic duties. Some
remain on after marriage, but not more than 1 or 2 per cent. A
few come back as widows. Married and unmarried as workers are
"six of one and half a dozen of the other," remarked an employer of
both, while another thought married women "less regular" in
attendance. There are no signs of married women lowering rates
of pay. "Time and a half" is the overtime rate. Women workers
who do not get paid overtime when they work beyond the normal
day get paid over the holidays, but not otherwise. There are no
fines. There is no trade organisation among the machine feeders,
and as the various unions of the men are not directly affected they
do not interfere. In some firms feeding has been done by girls for
a quarter of a century; in others they have been introduced only
within the last five or six years. Boys were rough, irregular, scarce,
and wanted higher pay. The girls, although they also are drawn
from a rough class, are steadier, cleaner, and more economical in the
use of material than boys. Besides, there are more of them. There
was no inducement for boys to continue at such work, so they have
been drafted into certain forms of unskilled, but fairly well paid,
labour, such as is offered by the Post Office or bread factories.
In some districts they go to the shipyards to assist riveters, and are
able to earn straight away twice the wages they would obtain in a
printing shop. As overtime by girls is restricted by legislation,
young men (over 18) are kept for feeding in one large jobbing-shop
where there are often seasons of great pressure (<i>e.g.</i>, in the printing
of penny monthly diaries and time-tables) and where "rushes" and
overtime are inevitable. These young men would not be thus
employed but for the restrictions of the Factory Acts, as the manager,
for reasons stated above, much prefers girls for feeding. While all
modern machines are fitted with self-fliers, not one of the many
attempts to provide automatic feeders has proved quite satisfactory.
For long runs such feeders as have been designed may serve fairly
well, but in shops with much jobbing and many short runs too much
time would be spent in adjusting the feeder to the particular job.
The sole advantages of a mechanical feeder are that it neither
"takes ill" nor "goes on strike." Meanwhile it is imperfect and
expensive, and the supply of cheap female labour abundant.</p>

<h3>
<span>(B.) <em>Lithographic Printing. Machine Feeding.</em></span>
</h3>


<p>What has been said of feeders under letterpress printing is
generally true of feeders in the lithographic branch. The only
difference seems to be one of social position. Girls employed in
feeding lithographic machines are "higher,"<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> "less filthy in talk,"
etc. They form the intermediate class, of which the girls in the
bookbinding and warehouse departments are at the top. In one
shop where all three classes are employed, the manager remarked
that these caste distinctions were "clean cut," and obvious to the
most casual observer.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_97" id="Footnote_97"></a><a href="#FNanchor_97"><span class="label">[97]</span></a> They are supposed to be lower in London, Manchester, etc.&mdash;[Ed.]</p></div>



<h3>
<span>(C.) <em>Letterpress Printing. Type-setting.</em></span>
</h3>



<p>The employment of women as compositors is a "vexed question."
In two shops only are they so employed in Glasgow, and both are
on the black list of the local trade union. Inasmuch as the conditions
which obtain in these shops differ in important respects, they
are here described separately.</p>

<p><strong>Firm No. 1</strong> introduced women as compositors some nine or ten
years ago, when a dispute with the union ensued. It now employs
about a dozen women at the cases. Girls are taken on at any age
after fourteen. In three months' time they are able to set up type
in "solid dig," <i>i.e.</i>, newspaper or book matter, consisting of solid
uniform paragraphs. Three girls who have spent about eight years
with this firm are declared to be "good at displaying," and "more
competent than the ordinary journeyman." Beginners get 6<i>s.</i> a
week during the first year, and in the third year are put on piecework
rates. There are no indentures. Capable women compositors
may earn 24<i>s.</i> a week, while their average earnings may be put at
22<i>s.</i> a week, and they never sink below a pound. Young workers
make an average of 18<i>s.</i> a week or thereabouts. The normal week
is one of fifty-one hours, made up as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>8 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. on four days.</p>
<p>8 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. on Wednesdays.</p>
<p>8 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Saturdays.</p>

<p>A compositor sometimes acts as "clicker," <i>i.e.</i>, checks the amount
of piecework, but this is usually done by a clerk. No married women
are employed. Overtime is paid time and a half, and women are
fined a penny for being late.</p>

<p><strong>Firm No. 2</strong> employed at one time about two dozen girls in the
composing-rooms. They were engaged solely on solid newspaper
work, and never in the higher branches of the trade, such as "displaying."
Seats were provided for them. They worked a forty-eight
hour week for a "stab" wage of 15<i>s.</i> or 16<i>s.</i>, and had three
weeks' holiday, off and on, for which they were paid. Further,
they were never turned away in slack time. But the experiment was
not altogether a success, and by to-day the two dozen have dwindled
down to two, who set for newspapers and get 16<i>s.</i> a week. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>reasons assigned for the gradual reversion to the employment of men
are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Irregularity of the women's attendance at work.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Their shorter hours.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Marriage.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) The introduction of the Linotype machine, of which there are
three in this establishment. This was urged as the most important
cause of the change back to men.</p>

<p>Of the work in general, it may be said that some intelligence is
needed, that no dangerous machinery is used, and that the health of
the workers depends largely on the character of the workroom.
The special trade disease is that to which men are similarly subject,
viz., "consumption" in some of its many forms.</p>

<p>In Glasgow the Typographical Association has strenuously, and,
with the above exceptions, successfully, resisted the introduction of
women into the composing-room. The attitude taken up by the men
may be summarised as follows: No objection would be offered to the
employment of women at the case provided that they served the usual
seven years' apprenticeship at the same rates as male apprentices, and
then on its completion were paid the full standard wage. "Underpaid
female labour is equally unjust to the legitimate employer and
employee." To allow women unrestricted access to the composing-rooms
would probably lead in time, not only to the reduction of the
men's wages, but to the undermining of the trade itself. The
various branches of the trade which now demand many years of
apprenticeship before they are completely mastered by one man
would be split up and distributed among a number of highly-specialized
workers. Women would be employed for separate
departments, and by being continuously kept at one job or branch
would become expert therein, but would have no knowledge of the
trade as a whole.</p>

<p>The employers, on the other hand, are aggrieved that, while the
union prevents women from acting as compositors in Glasgow, the
same trade society allows them to work in Edinburgh. The result
of the present arrangement is to divert a certain class of trade, viz.,
"solid dig," or book work, from other centres to Edinburgh. The
cause of this is to be found in the non-employment of women compositors
in Glasgow, and is not, as sometimes suggested, due to the
superiority of Edinburgh printing.</p>

<p>In answer to the claim of the union to equal pay for equal work
for women and men, it is urged by the masters:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Women when employed as compositors at piecework rates
get the best, <i>i.e.</i>, the simplest jobs. They are put to do what boys
would be at when half through their apprenticeship. They are kept
always at pretty much the same kind of work, and thus become very
skilful at it. Boys, on the other hand, would claim to be shifted on
to the higher branches of the trade.</p>

<p>(2) The man who now does the solid type-setting, which the
employer wishes to see a woman do, is paid higher than a woman
would or should be, because he is liable to be called on at any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
moment to undertake the more complex operations of his craft,
while a woman is not. In other words, the man is paid for potential
ability.</p>

<p>(3) If women were taken on freely to do solid setting, it is not at
all likely that they would seriously aspire to the higher stages of the
compositor's craft.</p>



<p>(<em>a</em>) Partly for physical reasons. Women are not fitted to handle
the heavy formes.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Partly because they could not be relied upon to go through a
full course of training. They would be continually leaving
in the middle or at the end of it, and employers, therefore,
would not take the trouble to train them. "The pick of the
girls get married. The qualities which make a girl smart
and successful at her work would similarly make for her
success in the marriage market."</p>

<p>(4) The cheaper type-setting of women is needed in order to compete
successfully with the Linotype machine. There is no doubt
that to a certain extent the comparatively low price of women's
labour tends to retard the introduction of machinery.</p>



<h3>
<span>(D.) <em>Bookbinding.</em></span>
</h3>


<p>In the bookbinding trade girls fold, put in plates and illustrations,
collate, sew by hand and by machine. Sewing used all to be done
by hand, but machines were introduced some fifteen years ago. In
the case of primers and stitched books girls do all except print the
covers. They make cloth cases as distinct from leather cases.
Girls also lay the gold leaf on covers, which are subsequently
stamped by machines operated by men. For at least half a century
women have worked in these branches, but while in earlier days
they learnt a variety of operations the tendency now is to keep
them to a special process or machine. Hence a smart girl can pick
up her task in a week. The old custom of a four years' apprenticeship
still survives. Girls start at fourteen, or at thirteen if they have
passed the fifth standard. The initial wage is still in some shops
3<i>s.</i> a week, but there is a decided upward tendency, which in one
case was found to reach 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for beginners. On the termination
of the apprenticeship an average wage of 10<i>s.</i> a week is paid, but in
the exceptional case referred to above the average was given as
12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, while 15<i>s.</i> is earned by expert pagers, coverers, and perforators
who have been in the employment of the firm for some
time. A chargewoman gets about 15<i>s.</i> a week, while the principal
forewoman in a firm employing nearly 300 girls in its bookbinding
branch is paid a guinea per week. Folders and hand-sewers are
paid piecework rates in the large shops, but not in the smaller ones.
To the casual visitor these pieceworkers exhibit a remarkable
swiftness and accuracy, and the work must involve no small physical
strain. Although the girls engaged in folding and the allied
processes are as a rule of higher intelligence than mill girls and
machine feeders and drawn from different social strata, there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
many who come, frail and under-fed, from very poor homes. To
these especially the early hour at which the day's work begins is a
hardship. On a Glasgow winter's morning to start work at 6.15 on
a hurried bite of bread and margarine, with the distant prospect of
more bread and margarine three hours later, leads logically to
"broken time." There has been some slight tendency towards
beginning at 8 o'clock and stopping on Saturdays at 1, but two of
the largest firms still adhere to 6.15 a.m. and finish on Saturdays at
10 a.m. The manager of one of these characterised the system as a
"relic of barbarism," and said he had tried to alter the hour to
8 o'clock, but the men vigorously opposed the change and the
scheme had to be dropped. As matters now stand, and owing to the
great irregularity of the attendance during the week, work has often
to go on from 11 till 2 on Saturdays. Otherwise in this establishment
overtime is systematically avoided, the manager maintaining that
the normal week of 52½ hours is quite exhausting enough for the
girls. When, as at seasons of unusual pressure, overtime is
reluctantly resorted to, it is paid time-and-a-quarter, as in the case of
men. The busy season lasts from August to March, but the girls
are hardly affected, and have plenty of work round the year. In
another large firm, where much railway printing is done, the
conditions differ somewhat. The hours are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>6.30 a.m. to 9 a.m.</p>
<p>10 a.m. to 2 p.m.</p>
<p>3 p.m. to 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Saturdays till 1 p.m.</p>

<p>There are small fines for spoilt work, but the money goes to the
Workers' Benevolent Fund. These fines do not amount to more
than sixpence per head per annum. Overtime is worked to the full
limit. It is paid at a higher rate, but not at the same proportionally
higher rate as men. Girls are never suspended in slack seasons, but
are put on time wages of 13<i>s.</i> or 14<i>s.</i> a week for the best workers.</p>

<p>The employment of married women is regarded as exceptional,
but all large firms have a small number of such&mdash;3 or 4 per cent.,
perhaps. The usual practice is for girls to come from school and
remain on until they get married or leave for some domestic purposes.
Some come back as widows or when living apart from their
husbands. Some firms boast a considerable number of workers who
have been employed for very long periods, ranging from 15 to 30
years and upwards. There are no signs of married women lowering
the rates of pay. It is customary for those who return after a
long absence to do so at the old wages. Efforts have been made
from time to time to organise the women into unions, but they have
invariably proved disappointing. Indirectly the women have gained
by the successful efforts of the men to shorten the hours of toil.
Generally speaking the attitude of the men's unions is not so much
one of hostility as of indifference to women's work, except where it
threatens to encroach on the men's preserves. There is no positive
agreement as to the line of demarcation; it is determined tacitly by
use and wont. The men profess to see a tendency among employers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
to extend the field of female labour. This extension of woman's
sphere they deprecate as likely to lead to the lowering of men's
wages. Just as men are never employed in folding in the bookbinding
department of a publishing firm, so certain processes are
invariably never done by women. As a rule men do the heavier and
more complicated work, while women do that which is preparatory
or supplementary. In jobbing-shops where odd volumes come in
to be bound in various styles women are unsuitable, and men do the
work right through; but in large publishing houses where orders
run into thousands women specialise on particular processes.
Women's work is apt to be extended where there are large
quantities involved and where the work can be sub-divided. While
women perform many of these sub-divisions quite as skilfully as men,
they do not exhibit a like concentration of effort, and are more
inclined to scamp.</p>

<p>Opinions differ as to the amount of homework done nowadays.
The plant required is just a folder&mdash;a piece of bone. There is no
doubt that to some extent folding is still done at home by the older
girls who have <em>during the day been employed in the factory</em>. One
employer admitted that on "not more than three or at most four
nights in the year" do girls take work home from his shop. The
cause is set down to the impatience of the public. Everybody wants
his order executed immediately. Rates paid for homework are, if
anything, a shade less than those paid for work done in the factory.
While such work increases the total earnings this is not the main
motive for undertaking it. A good deal of it is forced, and due to
the urgency of the public demand. During very busy months some
firms have a great deal of folding done as <em>outwork</em> by widows and
married women <em>not</em> now employed in the factory during the day. But
this practice is declining. Twopence per 1,000 extra is paid by one
firm, <i>i.e.</i>, 10<i>d.</i> as against 8<i>d.</i>, for this outwork to compensate for lack
of facilities in the home.</p>

<p>Despite the great number of sewing and folding machines introduced
in recent years there are probably more women employed at
the trade than ever. There is more work. The small shops tend
to retain women's labour. Their jobs are so small in amount and
varied in character that it would not pay them to introduce
machinery. Further, in the large shops, folding machines have not
always proved satisfactory. Doubtless, had men been engaged in
folding during the last fifty years, employers would ere this have
perfected a folding machine, but the cheapness of women's labour
takes away some of the incentive to invention. Sometimes the
introduction of a machine reduces women's work in one department
and increases it in another. Take as an example the wire-stitching
machine used in the production of tens of thousands of penny pocket
time-tables and diaries. If the diary is not out during the first three
days of the month it may as well not appear at all. There is a short
selling time during which sales are keen. Without the device of
the stitching machine the only way in which large quantities of such
ephemeral publications could be placed quickly on the market would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
be by the employment of a very large staff of women. But the big
and rapid output possible by means of the machine, although it
reduces the work of women stitchers, brings increased work to the
women folders.</p>


<h3>
<span>(E.) <em>Machine Ruling.</em></span>
</h3>



<p>Girls who start as feeders are sometimes promoted to the supervision
of simple ruling machines. Men look upon this with disfavour,
as it used to be considered their work. One firm is said to have
only two men now employed where there were once forty, and the
two that remain are tenters, who supervise the girls and the machines.
Machine ruling is paid at time rates. Wages rank as high as 17<i>s.</i> a
week, where men formerly got 28<i>s.</i> For more complex machines
girls would need to be specially trained, but managers think they
could easily be prepared, as intelligence rather than strength is
necessary. The girls themselves believe they would succeed if given
a chance.</p>


<h3>
<span>(F.) <em>Type and Stereotype Founding.</em></span>
</h3>


<p>No type founding is done in Glasgow, and no women are employed
here in stereotype founding. Such work is considered unsuitable
for women, and there seems no likelihood of their taking it up.</p>


<h3>
<span>(G.) <em>Paper Staining.</em></span>
</h3>


<p>This work has always been done by women. There is no formal
apprenticeship, but it takes a couple of years before the girls are
thoroughly initiated. They are taken on at thirteen or fourteen at a
wage of 4<i>s.</i> a week, paid 5<i>s.</i> at the end of the first year and 6<i>s.</i> at the
end of the second. Afterwards their wages range from 12<i>s.</i> to 14<i>s.</i>,
with an average of about 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per week. There is no piecework
and no fines are exacted. The working hours are 56 per week,
distributed as follows:&mdash;</p>


<p>6 a.m. to 9 a.m.</p>
<p>10 a.m. to 2 p.m.</p>
<p>3 p.m. to 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Saturdays, 6 a.m. to 9 a.m.</p>
<p>10 a.m. to 1 p.m.</p>


<p>Work is plentiful all the year round. No dangerous machinery is
used, and there is no special trade disease. The girls remain on till
they get married. They are drawn from the "better sort" of
working-class families, and some were reported as coming to the
factory on cycles. They have no trade organisation, and there do
not seem to have been any attempts on the part of the girls to
supplant men in the allied processes. No machinery has yet been
devised capable of doing the work of the girls.</p>



<h3>
<span>(H.) <em>Paper-box Making.</em></span>
</h3>


<p>Girls come from school and begin by dabbling about the shop and
running messages. Presently they become "spreaders," and in two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
or three years' time "coverers," the highest position open to them.
The cutting of the paper and cardboard is done by machines, which
men operate. The material thus prepared to the required sizes is
passed on to the girls to be glued up into boxes. The girls use no
machinery, and stand to their work at benches. At the height of
summer, and despite the gluey atmosphere of the workrooms, the
girls have the usual reluctance to open windows. Wages start at
3<i>s.</i> or 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Spreaders are paid from 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, to 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; coverers, 10<i>s.</i>
and 11<i>s.</i> Hours vary from shop to shop. Some begin at 8 and
finish at 6.30 (Saturdays, 12.30), with a meal hour at 1 o'clock.
Others allow an hour and a quarter for dinner, so as to enable girls
to get home. The week is then arranged as follows:</p>

<p>
7 a.m. to 9.15 a.m.
10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
3.15 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.
Saturdays, 7 a.m. to 9 a.m.
10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
</p>



<h3>
<span>(I.) <em>Pattern-book Making.</em></span>
</h3>


<p>This trade consists in making pattern-books for travellers, and is
usually found in close alliance with box-making. Girls get 4<i>s.</i> to
start, and rise to 13<i>s.</i> a week. The hours in one factory visited were
found to be as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>
8 a.m. to 1 p.m.
2 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.
Saturdays, 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. without a break.

<h2>
<span><a name="APPENDIX_IV" id="APPENDIX_IV">APPENDIX IV.</a></span>
<span class="smaller">WOMEN IN THE PRINTING TRADES IN BIRMINGHAM.
</span></h2>




<p>Fifteen firms were visited.</p>

<p>No women compositors were found in the chief printing businesses
visited in Birmingham. The wife of the manager of one factory
said that ten years ago in non-society places there had been a very
few women compositors in Birmingham. They took 15<i>s.</i>, as compared
to 33<i>s.</i> taken by the men compositors for the same work. It is
now fifteen years since the informant left the trade, and she believes
that at present none exist in Birmingham. She imagines that it is
the strength of the Compositors' Union which has driven them out.</p>

<p>Only one owner of a printing business considered that factory
legislation was detrimental to the interests of women in the printing
trade. He says that he keeps a number of youths where he would
otherwise employ women, as in stress of trade overwork has to be
done, including Sunday work, <i>e.g.</i>, at the time of the great cycle
boom. He tried to get permission for the women to work on Sunday,
but could not.</p>

<p>Another manager considered that the Compositors' Union spoilt
the chance of women workers in the printing trade. He himself, if
it were not for the Union, would like to train girl compositors. No
other printer expressed this opinion. All said that, on the whole,
men were better in the compositors' room, as they could be set
on any job, and the pressure of women would necessitate much
rearrangement.</p>


<h3>
<span>MACHINE RULING.</span>
</h3>

<p><em>Training and Wages.</em>&mdash;<em>Machine Ruling</em> is the only process for which
training can be said to exist. In some houses women are still articled
or apprenticed to this branch, but in many they simply learn their
trade as they can, from the foreman or forewoman. They generally
begin as machine feeders of the ruling machine. The secretary
of the Union of Bookbinders and Machine Rulers gave the
information that women had been first employed as machine
rulers about twenty years ago. He himself had learnt his trade
under a woman who was head of the whole department. The final
wage of a woman machine ruler is 17<i>s.</i> to 20<i>s.</i> In one case a
female ruler was taking 22<i>s.</i>, but I was told that was because she
was a relative of the employer. The minimum wage of a man
belonging to the Union is 32<i>s.</i> I was informed, however, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
man always worked a heavier machine, generally made the pens,
was responsible for the good condition of all the machines, and that
his output was always in advance of that of a woman.</p>

<p><em>Men and Women.</em>&mdash;In six businesses (the largest in Birmingham
visited) the proportion of women machine rulers is about three to
one man. An attempt was made about eight years ago to organise
the women machine rulers in Birmingham, but met with no response.
The secretary of the men's union informs me, "The reason why
the attempt failed is probably that they have little to complain of.
The wages vary from 4<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> per week for beginners, to £1 per
week of fifty-two hours."</p>



<h3>
<span>TABLE PROCESSES.</span>
</h3>

<p>All <em>table processes</em>, such as folding, knocking-up, gumming, numbering,
paging, interlaying, etc., are done by women. The average wage
varies from 8<i>s.</i> to about 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Numbering seems to be about the
best. Three numberers had taken 15<i>s.</i>, but the average maximum
was between 11<i>s.</i> and 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>



<h3>
<span>ENVELOPE MAKING.</span>
</h3>

<p><em>Training.</em>&mdash;A beginner is given a teacher, that is, a more experienced
worker, for six weeks. The teacher gets the profits of the
beginner's work, and the beginner is paid about 4<i>s.</i> per week.</p>

<p>All the work in the establishment was piecework, with the exception
of the new Scotch folding machine, which turns out 25,000
envelopes per day, as against 2,000 done by hand. The day wage
is 12<i>s.</i> per week.</p>

<p><em>Sub-divisions.</em>&mdash;Envelope folders take 7<i>s.</i> to 15<i>s.</i> The smallest
envelopes are 6<i>d.</i> per 1,000, the largest 1<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i></p>

<p><em>Average wage</em> for folding is 10<i>s.</i> to 12<i>s.</i> <em>Stamping</em>, 7<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i>
<em>Stitching</em>, 8<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i> <em>Gumming</em>, 10<i>s.</i> to 14<i>s.</i></p>

<p><em>General Remarks.</em>&mdash;Envelope making is not a seasonal trade.</p>

<p><em>Hours.</em>&mdash;Maximum, 49½ per week.</p>

<p>8.30 a.m. to 6.30 p.m., winter.</p>

<p>8 a.m. to 6 p.m., summer.</p>

<p>One week's holiday in August.</p>

<p>One week's holiday at Christmas.</p>



<h3>
<span>COLOUR PRINTING.</span>
</h3>

<p>Colour Printing takes about six months to learn well.</p>

<p><em>Wages.</em>&mdash;10<i>s.</i> to 12<i>s.</i> for a woman. A man employed on a heavier
machine took 20<i>s.</i></p>

<p>The forewoman takes 14<i>s.</i></p>


<h3>
<span>BOOKBINDING.</span>
</h3>


<p>By the rules of the Machine Rulers' and Bookbinders' Consolidated
Union women may only bind paper pamphlets. They are not
allowed to bind regular books. They may book-stitch with thread
or wire, glue, fold, bronze, and gild.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>



<h3>
<span>PAPER-BAG MAKING.</span>
</h3>


<h4>
<em>Business No. 1.</em>
</h4>


<p><em>Conditions.</em>&mdash;Cap bag-making is all piecework, except for beginners,
who start at 4<i>s.</i> In fifteen months, manager says they should be
able to earn 10<i>s.</i> per week by piecework.</p>

<p><em>Average Wage.</em>&mdash;13<i>s.</i> to 15<i>s.</i> Manager considered that in heavy
cap bag-making 19<i>s.</i> was top wage ever taken by an extra good
hand in extra busy time.</p>

<p>Eighteen girls were employed in cap bag-making.</p>

<p>A rougher class of girls were employed in the sugar bag department,
which is heavier work. The wages were higher for this
heavier work. The average wage approached 15<i>s.</i></p>

<p>The bag-stringing machine was the only machinery employed in
this business. It was worked by a foreman and forewoman. No
married women were employed. The clerks were all women, taking
20<i>s.</i> per week. The manager preferred them to men because they
were content with that wage as a maximum.</p>

<p><em>Outwork</em> given to old workers under known conditions, as since
the bags are for the grocery trade it is important to know home
conditions. Same price as for inworkers, but outworkers found their
own paste and brushes, etc.</p>

<p><em>Hours.</em>&mdash;8 a.m. to 7 p.m., 1 hour dinner, 20 minutes tea. Saturday,
8 a.m. to 1 p.m.</p>

<p><em>Remarks.</em>&mdash;The contrast between this business and the business
next door (see following case) was very striking as regards relation
between manager and employees.</p>


<h4>
<span><em>Business No. 2.</em></span>
</h4>


<p>Girls are employed here in bag-making and table processes. The
employer considered that the girls could average 9<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i> He
gave the highest wage for machine laying-on, which begins at 7<i>s.</i>
and goes up to 12<i>s.</i> and 13<i>s.</i> This wage was given because of the
danger of the process (I think the machine was the "Arab," which
in union houses women may not work "because of the danger").
Manager believed a good many of his hands were married women.
He did not care whether they were married or not. The forewoman
and the girl in the warehouse were each taking 11<i>s.</i></p>

<p><em>Homework.</em>&mdash;Given out in busy times to whoever applied, without
further precautions. Manager thought no outworker took more
than 4<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> per week.</p>

<p><em>Hours.</em>&mdash;8 a.m. to 6.30 p.m.</p>

<p>Fifty-two and a half hours per week regular time. Just now
(December) they were working ten hours per day.</p>

<p>August slackest month. Manager generally turned off hands
then. Manager spoke of difficulty of getting workers&mdash;he could
not get boys to feed the machines, for example, because it led to
nothing.</p>

<p>Manager said he "conducted his business on purely business
principles" and got his work done as cheaply as he could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>



<h3>
<span>MACHINE FEEDING.</span>
</h3>

<p>This is the lowest work in letterpress printing. Girls are employed
largely as feeders, and are replacing boys. The managers said that
the work was not liked by boys, as leading to nothing, and it was
difficult to get them. The wages for a machine feeder are 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to
5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> initial wage, which rises to 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> or 9<i>s.</i> In the best workshops
we were told that the firm tried to find better work for
machine feeders when they had been some time with them and had
proved themselves capable and steady. Other firms did not know
what became of machine feeders when they grew dissatisfied with
the small wage paid to them.</p>


<p><em>Employment of Married Women.</em></p>

<p>It is curious to notice how few married women there are in the
printing trade in Birmingham compared to the pen trade, for example.
A better class of girl seems to go into the printing trade, coming
from better homes than women employed in the hardware trades.
It is very exceptional for a girl who marries a skilled artisan in
Birmingham to continue her work, and in these trades girls appear
to belong more to the skilled artisan class. Several employers
refuse married women; one employer told me that he never had had
an application for work from a married woman. Only one employer
was indifferent as to whether he employed married women, and did
not know whether his hands were married or not.</p>


<p><em>Women and Machinery.</em></p>

<p>It was very difficult to ascertain whether the machinery introduced
meant dismissal of hands. In one business, for example, the thread
sewing machine introduced 12 months ago did the work of 12 girls.
The machinist was taking 12<i>s.</i> per week in place of 12 girls at 10<i>s.</i>
to 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> The manager said that they had not dismissed any thread
sewers when this machine was introduced, but had absorbed them in
other processes. They would, however, engage no more girls as
thread sewers.</p>

<p>The new Scotch folding machine for envelopes, which turns out
25,000 per day against 2,000 done by hand, also was <em>said</em> not to have
been productive of dismissals.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_98" id="Footnote_98"></a><a href="#FNanchor_98"><span class="label">[98]</span></a> The only actual cases of dismissal of workers owing to introduction of
machinery which I can ascertain is that of the new grinding machines for pens.
The employer, who has invented the machine, told me he meant to dismiss about
half his grinders and supply their places with girls fresh from school, as very
little skill will be needed to work the machine. I hear that the largest pen
business has ordered sixty of these machines, but I have not yet ascertained what
effect it will have on that business. The employer in the first business mentioned
spoke of the grinders as the most indocile of his workers, and as many of them
belonged to the Penworkers' Union, he hoped that the machine would help in
annihilating the union. In two businesses I was told that the cheapness of
women labour retarded the introduction of thread sewing machines, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p></div>


<p><em>Continuity of Employment in Printing Trade.</em></p>

<p>The printing trade in Birmingham is slackest in August and
September. The busiest times are November, December, and
towards Easter time. In the best businesses the hands are asked to
take half-holiday in turns in slack times, or short hours are worked,
but the managers appeared to make every effort to keep the workers
employed as far as possible, and in no cases actually to dismiss
hands. In the worst businesses dismissal in slack times is common.</p>


<p><em>Overtime and the Factory Laws.</em></p>

<p>Only one employer considered that the factory laws against
overtime militated against women's employment. All spoke of
their endeavour to reduce overtime, owing to the fact that their
union men asked one and a half and twice usual rate. No employer
acknowledged that women were ever kept overtime, although, from
the account of one worker, apparently this does sometimes occur.</p>

<p>All concurred that the cheapness of women's work compared to
men's outweighed any inconvenience arising from special legislation
for women and young persons. In no case was the cheapness of
women's work attributed to legislation, but to absence of unionism
and different standards of life for men and women, and inferiority of
physical strength and mental ingenuity, and also to custom.</p>

<p>These tables are also valuable on account of the light they throw
upon the organisation of the bookbinding trade in the middle of last
century. It will be seen for instance that the week indicated by
"October 11" in Table I was a specially busy week, and that in
consequence the payments made to the home workers were much
above those made for September 6th or 13th. Under September 6th,
twenty-eight home workers were engaged, and next week thirty-nine,
but under October 11th the number had risen to fifty-seven.
It is also worthy of note that E. Such was an indoor worker under
October 11th, but a home worker during the other two weeks,
whilst M. A. Joyce worked at home in the third week, but in the
workshop during the other two. This condition of disorganisation
has now fortunately almost disappeared from the trade.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that slight errors of a few farthings in the
additions have crept into the totals of some of the columns, but as
they do not affect the accuracy of the wage figures the Appendix has
been copied exactly as it was published.</p>
